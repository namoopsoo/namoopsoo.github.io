Darn, I was riding for at least one to two days thinking, why am I riding much slower? Last night I finally noticed that wow my rear wheel is really wobbly and rubbing up against the breaks quite a bit lately. This morning I finally started setting up to true the wheel. I marked the spoke which looked like adjusting it would have the highest impact. And wow I didnt notice it completely sheared off.

It took me just around 20 minutes or so to adjust.

The wobble was not completely gone, but it was dramatically reduced. I don't have a truing stand, but that would be a cool way to measure the warp.
