_Spoiler alert, don't do it_

I wrote some high level and low level markdown summaries for my [aviation kaggle data sciency project](https://github.com/namoopsoo/aviation-pilot-physiology-hmm). I placed them in the github repo of the project itself. Today I have been thinking about how to best _build_ the _Github Pages_ repo to showcase those markdowns that live in that other repository.

Looking for inspiration, I saw [this author](https://github.com/sajal2692/) has chosen to have a typical [github.io](https://github.com/sajal2692/sajal2692.github.io) repo and also a separate [portfolio repo](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio). On the other hand [this author's](https://github.com/chrisalbon/notes) approach was to maintain any source python notebook and markdown files within the main _GithubPages_ repo itself.

For my other two projects, [bam](https://github.com/namoopsoo/learn-citibike) and [babam](https://github.com/namoopsoo/time-parser), I ended up manually copying my `README.md` and what have you. I felt dirty doing it that way with all of the copy-pasta!

Having recently read [Richard Hamming's](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html) 1986 seminar on _dopeness_, the part that stuck with me the most was his notion of generalizability. I am paraphrasing, but he emphasized doing things with a multiplier effect. Ok now actually quoting, _"Instead of attacking isolated problems, I made the resolution that I would never again solve an isolated problem except as characteristic of a class."_ What a cry for open source this is. Anyway so living with intention, I am going to relocate my notes into the main Github Pages repo. What a transition!

A repo should still keep its `README` for sure, so I suppose that level of duplication is just unavoidable.
