I wrote some high level and low level markdown summaries for my [aviation kaggle data sciency project](https://github.com/namoopsoo/aviation-pilot-physiology-hmm). I placed them in the github repo of the project itself. Today I have been thinking about how to best _build_ the _Github Pages_ repo to showcase those markdowns that live in that other repository.

Looking for inspiration, I saw [this author](https://github.com/sajal2692/) has chosen to have a typical [github.io](https://github.com/sajal2692/sajal2692.github.io) repo and also a separate [portfolio repo](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio). On the other hand [this author's](https://github.com/chrisalbon/notes) approach was to maintain any source python notebook and markdown files within the main _GithubPages_ repo itself.

For my other two projects, [bam](https://github.com/namoopsoo/learn-citibike) and [babam](https://github.com/namoopsoo/time-parser), I ended up manually copying my `README.md` and what have you. I felt dirty doing it that way with all of the copy-pasta!
