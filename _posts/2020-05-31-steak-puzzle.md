I have been trying to solve the steak puzzle for several attempts now. That is, how do you cook a good cast iron to oven transfer? The problem so far has been that the recommended time for the oven for a 450 finish, in [this article](https://www.therisingspoon.com/2013/04/how-to-cook-perfect-steak-in-cast-iron.html?m=1) , 4-5 minutes is the recommendation for a medium steak and 2-4 minutes for a rare.

Although I did not quite follow the 450, I used 400 F, I followed the temperature lore from [here](https://www.foodandwine.com/how/grilling-mistakes-avoid-according-chefs) last night, using a meat thermometer instead of time, because I suspect oven temperatures in one oven is not the same as that of another. There are possibly incorrect temperature readings.

So with a temperature reading fluctuating between 110 and 100

with just 5 minutes after, just doing the stove top cast iron for now, here is what the inside looked like.

So I know doing these pre-cuts is sacrilegious, but I just wanted to see.

At this point, and oh I was trying this new Le Creuset grill pan that my partner in crime acquisitioned, I was just trying to see if the new grill pan can cook the steak to temperature without using the oven. I forgot to mention this steak was huge. It was like 2 to 3 inches in thickness mostly.

Anyway, the weird part next is that after several attempts in the oven at 400 F, after about 15 minutes in the oven, best reading I got was 128F,

And oddly enough after even more time in the oven, my readings fell down back to 120 F.

At this point we (I) just ate the steak. The steak at this point (now maybe 30 minutes in the oven?) was clearly well done.

I guess I only took one photo because it was still tasty with a lot of Utah salt.

But nonetheless I am confused by the discrepancy of 130F being a temp according to that Food & Wine article as being a "medium rare" classification.

But bone-the-less, at this point I suspect either the thermometer is faulty after being exposed to super high heat the other day (300+ even though it is only rated to 220) or the steak actually cools extremely fast after I take it out of the oven to do the measurement? Anyway my partner in crime here suggested I make a pie for which the temp for me at least consistently reads 170 for done-ness and in comparing the thermometer outcome in a known scenario I will take the excuse to make a pie  thank you!
