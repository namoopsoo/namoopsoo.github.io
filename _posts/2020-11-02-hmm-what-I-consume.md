#### Quick idea around more active content consumption
* My goal is to write about/ annotate what I read/ watch
* Just came up with a pattern of consumption to enable this. So on a youtube video for example,
    * I can "Share" into "Dropbox" , specifically into a new folder say, of just metadata
    * Then I found [this youtube api doc](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/videos/list) where you can actually give the hyoutube api a youtube id and it will give you the metadata, like title, channel name, date, etc
    * Then in a separate place, I can have my actual notes but they can now get linked together more easily, because I have the matching metadata.
* Anyway, just the beginning of a thought here.
