Trying out this Blue Bottle Opascope espresso w/ this hand grinder w/ my Kamira espresso maker. But the Kamira is not pulling the espresso for some reason.

Comparing the Lavazza grounds to the Opascope grounds I can't tell there's a difference. Is it too fine? Not fine enough?

This is the hand grinder.

Here is what 2 out of 4 of the Blue Bottle pulls ended up like

And after that I did a Lavazza pull and it looked pretty normal..

#### Tried to use same grind level but also tamping this time
* Going to call this grind level 1. So "tamping" means using force to "compact" the grinds into the filter. This is not typically done w/ a Kamira filter. But tried it this time..
* And result was no pull and a swimming pool at the end

#### Grind level 2 , no more tamping
* ended up with half a pull..

#### Also tried grind level 3...

This time basically no pull. And slightly watery filter afterwards also.

#### Next?
Not sure what's next. Maybe going to try to fix the pressure on the Kamira.
