Two updates to the  <a href="{% post_url 2020-05-31-steak-puzzle %}">earlier steak post</a>. Earlier, I was getting a really low temperature on the meat thermometer I was using and I am pretty sure now that was because I was only dipping just the tip as opposed to basically burying the thermometer lengthwise. This time around I seem to be getting the expected temperature, above 130 F and even above 140 F, whereas before this temperature was not registering even though I had validated that it was working on some pie for instance.

I have not condensed this to proper text yet but here's the recipe used for the above corresponding steak.
