#### Tust trawling image search for some inspiration

##### Clamped
 From [here](https://www.gottabemobile.com/ergotron-workfit-p-sit-stand-workstation/), like the clamp since it doesn't take over your entire desk. But I'm only seeing enough space for a laptop and hmm not a whole monitor.

##### Bracket for big screens
 This [one](https://www.homedit.com/standing-desk-designs-and-extensions/) though , wow looks like an extension for your screen too nice.

##### Hmm permanant tall desk
 Actually, reading [that home Edit site](https://www.homedit.com/ikea-standing-desk/) more, I like the concept of just having a tall desk to begin with. And a nice soft mat to stand on. And then you can bring in a nice stool to sit on whenever you want to sit. Brilliant

##### Wall mounted
Also from [home edit](https://www.homedit.com/ikea-standing-desk/) wow, he hiding your wires part and the slim design. And again you just need to find a good stool.
