#### Tust trawling image search for some inspiration

##### Clamped
 From [here](https://www.gottabemobile.com/ergotron-workfit-p-sit-stand-workstation/), like the clamp since it doesn't take over your entire desk. But I'm only seeing enough space for a laptop and hmm not a whole monitor.

##### Bracket for big screens
 This [one](https://www.homedit.com/standing-desk-designs-and-extensions/) though , wow looks like an extension for your screen too nice.

##### Hmm permanant tall desk
 Actually, reading [that home Edit site](https://www.homedit.com/ikea-standing-desk/) more, I like the concept of just having a tall desk to begin with. And a nice soft mat to stand on. And then you can bring in a nice stool to sit on whenever you want to sit. Brilliant

##### Wall mounted
Also from [home edit](https://www.homedit.com/ikea-standing-desk/) wow, he hiding your wires part and the slim design. And again you just need to find a good stool. Less space for a treadmill under that if it is against the wall I suppose.

Also this wall desk saves so much space I imagine you can just have a sit down desk as well. Just need to move your laptop around.

##### Side note or back note
The cable management rear mounted with holes [here](https://www.homedit.com/standing-desk-designs-and-extensions/)  from [Artifox](https://theartifox.com/) looks nice but I could not find this sold separately on the site.

##### This motorized standing desk though

Pretty expensive I think $600 bug elegant. But is it an assumption that the monitor height you use whilst seated is the monitor height you need standing? Are your elbows doing something else when you are standing?  ( Originally a [kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/movi/movi-the-standing-desks-that-elevate-your-workspac) but now I see you can [buy it](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/movi/movi-the-standing-desks-that-elevate-your-workspac) )
