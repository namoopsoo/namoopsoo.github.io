Coming at this from a place of selection bias, I might say I have always favored being a generalist but actually to me this book was a breath of fresh air. It's true, the job market has told me at least a few times that I have not specialized enough. After the stories of Edison, and others, I feel many people can lose a bit of their imposter syndrome and actually be more proud of their diverse backgrounds.

- Bill Gore, Gore Tex and "dabble time" as a cultural staple.
- Yoshinori Ohsumi, Nobel lecture closing, "Truly original discoveries in science are often triggered by unpredictable and unforseen small findings. Scientists are increasingly required to provide evidence of immediate and tangible applications of their work."

I thought wow, not just businesses but also science wow, need to show that anticipated ROI. This also connects with the book I had just read prior, Team of Teams, where I learned of the birth of Taylorism whicih plagues us with "efficiency" ( which is really micromanagement in disguise).

Why is it that the cult of assembly-lining all work even what is referred to as "wicked" in Range as opposed to "Kind". I feel like I understand the desire to feel like you are in control, but it's like Nassim Taleb's notion in "AntiFragile" that the causality around higher education and success in Western democracies has been flipped. He believes the institutions came after the success and have not proven themselves to cause it. Similarly, our society is slowly learning that the "management class" similarly knows how to seek out successful individuals and lay claim to their outcomes.

So going back to the proving of ROI in business, science or on the personal level, to quote a former boss, it has got to do with "trust". If you can demonstrate your method yields good outcomes even without having planned 100% of your work ( in fact despite other peoples attempts at trying to plan "at you" or plan "around you" while you work) then people will leave you alone and let you produce "good work" as Hamming noted in his address I read, from 1986, where he talks about "how the individual gets very successful research done in spite of anything the managemenet does or in spite of any other opposition."

One of the ideas from Range is that elite athletes elite musicians and others, become elite by experimentation as opposedto specialization early on. The Dark Horse Project was also mentioned, because it is not on purpose what our journeys are. Those people had meandering paths. The question is maybe un-answered, what if you seek out meandering path onpurpose? And how do you do this? Explore vs Exploit?

So yea what about the people who do follow the specialized path? What do they do?

- "learning itself is best done slowly to accumulate lasting knowledge even when that means performing poorly on tests of immediate progress. That is the most effective learning looks innefficient, it looks like falling behind."
