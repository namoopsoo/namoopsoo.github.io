# About page

Hi my name is Michal Piekarczyk and I am a builder. Especially with data! [Here](https://github.com/namoopsoo/learn-citibike) is my effort to predict bike share rider destinations. [Here](https://github.com/namoopsoo/aviation-pilot-physiology-hmm) I used TensorFlow with physiological time series data to predict a pilot's state of awareness (thanks Kaggle!). [Here](https://github.com/namoopsoo/time-parser) I built a serverless nosql service to collect and describe where my time goes.

In my day job, I data science at [Katapult.com](https://katapult.com), solving problems with data all day and improving our machine learnings.

And I also like to [tell jokes](http://dadjests.com). Sometimes I [build chair](https://my-blog-content.s3.amazonaws.com/2018/chair/2017-06-01+22.15.02-chair.jpg) (singular). In high school, my teammates and I built robots for [FIRST Robotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRST_Robotics_Competition)
