      <description>Two updates to the earlier steak post. Earlier, I was getting a really low temperature on the meat thermometer I was using and I am pretty sure now that was because I was only dipping just the tip as opposed to basically burying the thermometer lengthwise. This time around I seem to be getting the expected temperature, above 130 F and even above 140 F, whereas before this temperature was not registering even though I had validated that it was working on some pie for instance.</description>
