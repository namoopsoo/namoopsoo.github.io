#### Asked Vimeo support and answering some questions

#####  What version of the app am I running?
Version 8.4.1

#####  Any error messages after starting the upload?
* An error I see when I go to look my videos on https://vimeo.com/manage/videos  "Optimization pending..." , "This is taking a while. Try refreshing the page, or come back later." when I click on any of the videos there.

#####  How much free space is available on my mobile device and how large is the file?
* 61.9 GB of 64 GB Used
* Videos ranging from 100MB to 500MB


#####  Was the video being uploaded shot on the same device? Or imported from elsewhere?
Yes

#####  Is the device (my phone) connected by WiFi or cellular? Different results?
Tried both.

#### Ahhh So the storage ewas the issue.
* I increased the free space from 3GB to 8GB and now upload works. Yay.
