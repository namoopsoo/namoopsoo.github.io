title: Remember to Floss Your Batteries

Today I thought it would take me maybe half an hour to replace my laptop battery. I got a replacement in the mail. Actually funny enough they are called the "function keys" battery because there are three cells . 

Anyway, turns out they are glued to the inside and you need some kind of epoxy loosener. I randomly stumbled on this video someone put together using some kind of wax line to actually remove batteries. Well I didn't have wax thread, but I had floss so umm hey why not try that?
