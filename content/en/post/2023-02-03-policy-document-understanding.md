title: More notes from a recent hackathon
date: 2023-02-05

Spending a few spare moments to summarize some of my thought processes from a recent hackathon.

### What is all this
So I was glad to be part of a really cool hackathon team recently at my company and here are some of my perspectives from the experience.

### Plan of action
So We settled to constrain our problem space to apply langchain, a library that wraps around large language model APIs notably the OpenAI API, to show language understanding from a publicly available  health insurance plan summary of benefits document. We ended up starting out with this public facing document, which one can seee a description of [here](https://www.medicareadvantage.com/plans/humana-community-hmo-h1036-236-000) with its download link [https://content.sunfirematrix.com/2023/Humana-H1036-236-000-SB-EN-2023-SF20220922.pdf](here) .

### My thought around structured data
Hackathons are always very time crunch like environments. I very much wanted us to have at least a minimal end to end demo in our back pocket just in case our additional progress does not pan out.
  
#### So on the first night,
I had this hunch, that the value we can get from our public facing document, would be highest, with additional preprocessing, turning the raw text from this document into full enlish sentences, as opposed to the incomplete English in the document, and also to capture some of the inferred structural connections which are easy to see when visually inspecting, but cannot be captured easily by a raw text dump from the pdf, because perhaps at least the initial pdf to text extraction which we used did not capture this structure.
  
#### One quick example of this, 
For instance, here are two tables from the pdf document, that describe the "Mail Order Cost-Sharing" and the "Retail Cost-Sharing" options for prescription drug benefits

At the outset I handrewrote this as the following clauses

  ```
  This plan has Prescription Drug Benefits .
  Here is information about what You Pay for Vaccines .
  Our plan covers most Part D vaccines at no cost to you, no matter what cost-sharing tier itâ€™s on .
  
  Here is information about What You Pay for Insulin .
  You wonâ€™t pay more than $35 for a one-month (up to 30-day) supply of each Part D insulin product covered by our plan, no matter what cost-sharing tier itâ€™s on . This applies to all Part D covered insulins, 
  including the Select Insulins covered under the Insulin Savings Program as described below. 
  What you pay for prescription drugs depends on whether you receive "Extra Help" or not.
   If you receive "Extra Help", you will still pay no more than $35 for a one-month supply for each Part D covered insulin. 
  Please see your Prescription Drug Guide to find all Part D insulins covered by your plan. 
  This plan does not have a deductible for prescription drugs. 
  If you don't receive Extra Help for your drugs, you'll pay a different amount based on the type of cost-sharing option you use.
  For the Initial coverage, you are responsible to pay for a 30-day supply or a 90-day supply the amount based on the tier of the prescription drug. A prescription drug can be either in tier 1 preferred generic, tier 2 generic, tier 3 preferred brand, tier 4 non-preferred drug, or tier 5 specialty tier. You are responsible to pay for prescription drugs until the total yearly drug costs reach $4,660 . The total yearly drug costs are the total drug costs paid by both you and our plan. Once you reach this amount, you will enter the Coverage Gap. 
  There are two different kinds of cost-sharing for prescription drugs, including Mail Order Cost-Sharing and Retail Cost-Sharing. There are two different kinds of Mail Order pharmacy options, Standard and Preferred. The Mail order pharmacy option called Standard includes Walmart Mail, PillPack and other pharmacies that are also available in our network. To find pharmacy mail order options go to Humana.com/pharmacyfinder  . The second type of mail order pharmacy option is the Preferred pharmacy option, which includes only the CenterWell Pharmacy.
  For the Standard Mail order pharmacy option, for Tier 1 Preferred Generic drugs, the 30-day supply costs $10 and the 90-day supply costs $30.
  For the Standard Mail order pharmacy option, for Tier 2 Generic drugs, the 30-day supply costs $20 and the 90-day supply costs $60.
  For the Standard Mail order pharmacy option, for Tier 3 Preferred Brand drugs, the 30-day supply costs $47 and the 90-day supply costs $141.
  For the Standard Mail order pharmacy option, for Tier 4 Non-Preferred drugs, the 30-day supply costs $100 and the 90-day supply costs $300.
  For the Standard Mail order pharmacy option, for Tier 5 Specialty Tier drugs, the 30-day supply costs 33% and the 90-day supply is not available.
  For the Preferred CenterWell Pharmacy Mail order pharmacy option, for Tier 1 Preferred Generic drugs, the 30-day supply costs $0 and the 90-day supply costs $0.
  For the Preferred CenterWell Pharmacy Mail order pharmacy option, for Tier 2 Generic drugs, the 30-day supply costs $0 and the 90-day supply costs $0.
  For the Preferred CenterWell Pharmacy Mail order pharmacy option, for Tier 3 Preferred Brand drugs, the 30-day supply costs $42 and the 90-day supply costs $116.
  For the Preferred CenterWell Pharmacy Mail order pharmacy option, for Tier 4 Non-Preferred drugs, the 30-day supply costs $100 and the 90-day supply costs $290.
  For the Preferred CenterWell Pharmacy Mail order pharmacy option, for Tier 5 Specialty Tier drugs, the 30-day supply costs 33% and the 90-day supply is not available.
  The other kind of prescription drug cost sharing is called Retail Cost-Sharing, which means that you can physically go to the pharmacy. You can go to any network retail pharmacy.  To find the retail pharmacies near you, go to Humana.com/pharmacyfinder 
  For the retail pharmacy option, for Tier 1 Preferred Generic drugs, the 30-day supply costs $0 and the 90-day supply costs $0.
  For the retail pharmacy option, for Tier 2 Generic drugs, the 30-day supply costs $0 and the 90-day supply costs $0.
  For the retail pharmacy option, for Tier 3 Preferred Brand drugs, the 30-day supply costs $42 and the 90-day supply costs $116.
  For the retail pharmacy option, for Tier 4 Non-Preferred drugs, the 30-day supply costs $100 and the 90-day supply costs $300.
  For the retail pharmacy option, for Tier 5 Specialty Tier drugs, the 30-day supply costs 33% and the 90-day supply is not available.
  
  ```

Maybe there are really good libraries for inferring the generically inferring the tabular structure , but at least for the time being I really wanted to constrain the problem a bit more since my brain was in hackathon mode haha  ðŸ˜…

### A fully end to end version 1 demo
So the [day before](https://michal.piekarczyk.xyz/post/2023-02-01-lang-chain-small-talk/) I had already proven to myself,  that the #langchain `LLMChain` class is really good at having a targeted conversation framed  around some kind of small talk, with the use of a prompt that provides the focus. Also , [earlier](https://michal.piekarczyk.xyz/post/2023-01-29-lang-chain-quick-look/), I had shown myself just how quickly  haha, no, instantaneously, you can use #langchain to  embed a targeted bit of text, a section of a magazine article in my case, and run question answering based on this.
  
I have not tried it yet but langchain also has the concept of an agent, which can compartmentalize separate functionality, say for engaging in small talk and separately for answering questions on an insurance plan document. 
  
Already having some components already working in front of me, I wanted to at least first build a super simple demo, more or less jamming together the small talk prompts I had explored earlier with the document focused question answering.

#### I ended up with something like this 

  ```python
  from langchain import OpenAI, ConversationChain, LLMChain, PromptTemplate
  from langchain.chains.conversation.memory import ConversationalBufferWindowMemory
  from langchain import PromptTemplate
  
  
  name_of_person = "Alfred Jamesmanson"
  real_person_prompt = f"""

  Assistant  loves making new friends.
  If at any time {name_of_person} asks  to talk with a real person that {name_of_person} should only ask and they will be connected to a real person. Assistant will remind {name_of_person} that they can connect to speak to a real person whenever they would like that. If {name_of_person} asks to talk to a real person then Assistant will let {name_of_person} know they will be connected to talk to a real person right away.
  """
  
  person_details = f"""
  Assistant is designed to talk to {name_of_person} and answer their questions.

  {name_of_person} is friends with Kelly Robin, Jesse Lambourghini and Jackson Loggin.

  """
  
  filename = "summary-of-benefits-paragraphs.txt"
  with open(filename) as f:
      document_text = f.read()
      len_doc = len(document_text )
      print("len doc is ", len_doc)
      document_text = document_text[:(len_doc//2)]
  
  base_template = f"""Assistant is a large language model trained by OpenAI.

  {name_of_person}:""" 
  template = base_template + """ {human_input}
  Assistant:
  """
  
  prompt = PromptTemplate(
      input_variables=["human_input"], 
      template=template
  )
  
  chatgpt_chain = LLMChain(
      llm=OpenAI(temperature=0), 
      prompt=prompt, 
      verbose=True, 
      memory=ConversationalBufferWindowMemory(k=3),
  )
  
  human_input = "Hi my name is Alfred Jamesmanson. I need your help Assistant. What color is my hair?"
  
  while True:
      human_input = input(": ")
      output = chatgpt_chain.predict(
        human_input=human_input,
      )
  
      print(output)
  ```

#### And I ended up, above, cutting the document in half, because my prompt had too many tokens  looks like.

  ```

#### I would like to understand these limitations a bit better and also how to get around then at a later point !

##### conversation  1

  ```
  : hello there
  > Finished chain.
  Hi there! How can I help you?
  : can I talk to a real person?
  > Finished chain.
  Yes, of course! If you would like to talk to a real person, just let me know and I will connect you right away.
  : can you please connect me with a real person?
  > Finished chain.
  Of course! I can connect you with a real person right away. Please hold while I connect you.
  ```

Trying out the real person part of the prompt. Actually initially I thought it was not working but then clearly confirmation was just requested.
  
So I wonder if that langchain agent can somehow help to route this conversation along to a human at this point.
  
Continuing that one, 

  ```
  : so by the way how is your day going so far?
  > Finished chain.
  
  Hi Alfred Jamesmanson! My day is going great so far. I'm learning a lot and having a lot of fun. How about you?

  > Finished chain.
  For tier 2 drugs, you are responsible for 25% of the cost for a 90 day supply.
  : what emergency services copay do i need to pay?
  
  > Finished chain.
  For emergency care, the copay is $110. If you are admitted to the hospital within 24 hours, you do not have to pay your share of the cost for the emergency care. Urgently needed services have a $20 copay at an urgent care center.
  ```

  : can i talk to a real person please?
  
  > Finished chain.
  Of course! I can connect you to a real person right away. Just let me know when you're ready and I'll get you connected.
  : yes I am ready.                                                 
  
  > Finished chain.
  Great! What can I help you with?
  ```
  So this was an important ending my teammate asked me to write that last part, "yes I am ready" to see if memory held up and in this case clearly it did not haha!

  I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling frustrated. Is there anything specific I can help you with?
  
  ```

I like that last bit at the end about responding to frustration.

I am curious to better understand just how much structure is helpful around the contextual document that is provided. Running some tests would be a cool exercise at some point.
