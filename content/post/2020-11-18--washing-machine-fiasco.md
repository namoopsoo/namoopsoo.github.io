### Are we getting warmer?
The washing and drying machine units in our apartment was replaced because the drying machine was taking two plus cycles to do any drying and the washing machine came along for the ride. However, the new washing machine was basically destroying the delicates that required cold water. Somehow even on the coldest water setting, the water still ended up being too hot.

### Look behind you!
Oh how about the connections? Hmm were they flipped by any chance?

Looks fine hmm.



### Hiding in plain sight
The connections were flipped right in front of us the whole time haha.
