I have no idea how I managed to get on my bus to DC this morning. My Citibike station I planned on, was full, then my phone is Unavailable until like 10:42 .

Bus boards at 11:00am . Still got to find a citibike dock to park the bike, because the stolen citibike fee is $1,250. At 10:42 of course I open phone and have absolutely no cell service. The citibike station does not have a printed map on it. I open my Google map because it magically had still on the screen some citibike locations. I quickly ride 2 blocks up praying it has docks. Had a free dock! I run back with suit case to bus location . It is not super easy to find and this is the first time I am using thejet.coach . But I see it eventually. I go to a mall first that claims to have Starbucks at 10:50. I don‚Äôt see it . I leave. I see a street level Starbucks . Go inside . 10 people in line . no time. I have no water prepared for a 4 hour trip. I run to bus. It‚Äôs 10:55. I ask can I take 4 minutes to look for water? They say ok. I have no cash . But food vendor a block away takes Credit card. I have water. Run back to bus. 10:59. Still no cell service . I try to show a ticket photo from before . But it was   my moms ticket which is for a different day . It says Anna . I am not Anna. They are confused üòê. I show them my ID. That is adequate ü•≤. They let me inside. Inside there is 10 people sharing a whole bus . I‚Äôm in the front . All good now.
