So my friend and I were discussing the general topic of what happens to our employability as people once we reach the age of retirement. My feelings on this are I am hopeful and I think people can retain their skills and probably express different kinds of skills too. (some call this wisdom =D ).

At this point my friend introduced some dark humor, citing this  [link](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html#fn1) with an actuarial table, saying that,   

> "Most people over 75 are unemployable simply for the fact that they’re dead now"

So I like jokes but I figured it was important to fact check his joke here, so in looking at this table, a subset of it,

I stitched together this table, and modified the joke as follows 

> “Most people over 80.5 are unemployable simply for the fact that they’re dead now “
