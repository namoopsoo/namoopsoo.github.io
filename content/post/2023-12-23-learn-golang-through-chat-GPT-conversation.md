title: Some of my notes through learning Golang by conversing with ChatGPT

## I have not messed around with Golang yet and figured why not try to learn this through just chatting with ChatGPT? 

Not a full conversation below , but just using this to jot down some notes. And most of the code examples I'm pasting below are from ChatGPT.


## Error handling is very different in Go
So no exceptions like Python. Instead, you can give a return tuple type from a function like this and the second term will be a error code.


```go
func divide(a, b float64) (float64, error) {
    if b == 0 {
        return 0, errors.New("division by zero")
    }
    return a / b, nil
}

func main() {
    result, err := divide(10.0, 0)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error:", err)
        return
    }
    fmt.Println("Result:", result)
}

```

## Attaching functions to struct types 
So there are no classes per se. You can however attach methods to structs, with this additional syntactic sugar, below. 

There is an additional `(r Rectangle)` squished in between `func` and `Area` and the arguments are an empty `()`. 

In addition , an interface is defined also below, `Shape`, which carries a subset of the methods that are defined on the struct type `Rectangle`.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Define a struct
type Rectangle struct {
    Width, Height float64
}

// Define a method on the struct
func (r Rectangle) Area() float64 {
    return r.Width * r.Height
}

// Define an interface
type Shape interface {
    Area() float64
}

func main() {
    var s Shape = Rectangle{Width: 10, Height: 5}
    fmt.Println("Area:", s.Area())
}
```

In addition, I was inquiring in the above , why bother specifying that the return of `Area` in the interface `Shape` is `float64` if we already know the type from the earlier definition of `Area` earlier. And the response was that more or less the interface is a contract and that types "might" implement  it or they might not. 

### Indeed, I tried changing the return type to see what would happen
So only updating that one thing, I tried running the below in https://go.dev/play/ 
```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Define a struct
type Rectangle struct {
	Width, Height float64
}

// Define a method on the struct
func (r Rectangle) Area() int {
	return r.Width * r.Height
}

// Define an interface
type Shape interface {
	Area() float64
}

func main() {
	var s Shape = Rectangle{Width: 10, Height: 5}
	fmt.Println("Area:", s.Area())
}
```

and actually first I got a message that multiplying floats will not produce an `int`. Very nice.
```
./prog.go:12:9: cannot use r.Width * r.Height (value of type float64) as int value in return statement
```
And I also got the message, 

```
./prog.go:21:16: cannot use Rectangle{â€¦} (value of type Rectangle) as Shape value in variable declaration: Rectangle does not implement Shape (wrong type for method Area)
		have Area() int
		want Area() float64
```
and the line 21 above is the `var s Shape = Rectangle{Width: 10, Height: 5}` , so, cool, as expected, this is an error not on the interface, not on the type implementing the interface, but on the declaration that attempts to use the type `Rectangle` claiming to implement the interface `Shape`. Interesting.

And indeed when I fix the types of `Width` and `Height` to `int` in `Rectangle` and comment out that line `21` above, the program actually has no compile error, so then looks like this is a runtime error only.

## Behavior of passing objects into functions
Ok, we have pass by value behavior and we have pass by reference behavior, depending on the type. 

Wow, i learned that the size of a Go array is part of its type and therefore you must define a different function for different sizes of arrays as inputs. 

But this is not true of slices as function parameters, which   also have a pass by reference behavior as opposed to array pass by value behavior and so overall seems like passing slices to functions is the way to go.

```go
```

## HTTP server with channels for delegating to  workers

Discussing this, I was asking , hey if I want to build a web server with Golang, with a listener that receives HTTP requests and then pushes them to channels for available workers to consume , are channels good option for this or would this cause the listener go routine to block on channel push operations? 

Chat GPT reminding me that, unbufferes channels block but also buffered channels that are "full" also block. 

But the recommendation was to use a channel with a capacity that is large enough to handle peak loads, and then that would prevent a listener from blocking on a push to the channel.

Yea good point!
