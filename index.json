And as a first stab, a corpus was built with, hey why not, the code from the #sentence-transformers repo.\nThe documentation at https://www.sbert.net/examples/applications/semantic-search/README.html#python was used for the basic test here. And a small bit of code at the bottom here, shows how the lines from the python source files were written to a python list first.\nAlso, the test results here look pretty decent, but the next step will be to create a reference set of the line numbers that were expected to be found, to get a good precision/recall score for this.\nInitial Learnings Learned about [[symmetric vs asymmetric semantic search]] Here is the explanation, https://www.sbert.net/examples/applications/semantic-search/README.html#symmetric-vs-asymmetric-semantic-search . This distinction refers to #[[sentence similarity task]] where the query is of the same size or asymmetrically, smaller size, such as a one or two word query. And wow that is exactly what I was looking for ! So apparently this includes the \u0026ldquo;msmarco\u0026rdquo; models.\nFinal test run Had a few test runs today, iterating on the approach, using queries from files other than the ones I built a corpus for , #moment/doh haha . Also weirdly the msmarco model documented as the v3 that should be used is MIA somehow, but the v2 seems fine. And \u0026ldquo;msmarco-MiniLM-L-6-v3\u0026rdquo; is fine too.\nBut here is the last run for today. 18:43 lets try just a few files, so I had initially passed queries I wrote out for the CrossEncode.py file , #moment/doh haha , so that is why below, I am pulling 'msmarco-MiniLM-L-6-v3' and re-encoding because I was puzzled w/ the initial lackluster results and was trying a different model.

Dig deeper What\u0026rsquo;s with the food photos? There are some earlier notes here about how the food photos get split out. The purpose here is that at one point I was inspired by a Peter Attia statement about how you might have various fluctuations in your metabolic health, but that you can typically look back at what you were eating when you were doing more or less well. Looking at the macro nutrient data like in this post is great too, but it is also nice to have the parallel photographic information to help inform you what it is that you are eating.\nMaking curating the photos slightly less tedious Earlier here, I described building a local flask app that can be accessed by ipad say, to help other photos that cannot yet be automatically sorted by a model such as the food-not-food model.\nFuture though But later on the food-not-food model can be extended to also sort out receipts and any other photos I don\u0026rsquo;t exactly want in my pristine gallery.\n","permalink":"https://michal.piekarczyk.xyz/project/2023-photo-unchaos/","summary":"an interlude to having better grasp of an unwieldly photo situation","title":"How to unchaos your photos?"},{"content":"TLDR Diabetes is what happens when high blood sugar wreaks havoc on the body because either with type I diabetes, the pancreas cannot produce insulin for various reasons or with type II diabetes, no matter how much insulin the pancreas produces, it is not enough insulin to meet the high levels of blood sugar because of insulin resistance (insulin is ignored by cells and blood sugar is not taken up). But fortunately dietary carbohydrate is the main lever here.\nMy summary is that at this point we have enough long term studies (at least a year) comparing low carb, very low carb, mediterranean diets, low fat diets etc, that the American Diebetes Association chose to cite them in 2019, (https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/42/5/731/40480/Nutrition-Therapy-for-Adults-With-Diabetes-or), weighing in that hands down the very low carb diets will help you manage your glycemic outcomes on type I or II diabetes, and the A1C outcomes will be equal to or better than what available medications can do. But they strongly underline that registered dietician nutritionists are the key factor because although very low carb and even mediterranean styles have strong outcomes, adherence is the biggest barrier. But as they write, medical nutrition therapy is a covered medicare benefit, so that is good news.\nSome quoting from that ADA Report My go-to for links to the latest nih studies and just well written articles on this topic is dietdoctor.com, and I\u0026rsquo;m glad that here they pointed out the ADA report, \u0026ldquo;Nutrition Therapy for Adults With Diabetes or Prediabetes: A Consensus Report\u0026rdquo;. It is amazing that it took the ADA until 2019 to write this, but they finally did it!\nThis report starts out with a strong statement about the efficacy of nutrition as a therapy of diabetes And that it saves money!\n“This Consensus Report is intended to provide clinical professionals with evidence-based guidance about individualizing nutrition therapy for adults with diabetes or prediabetes. Strong evidence supports the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of nutrition therapy as a component of quality diabetes care, including its integration into the medical management of diabetes; therefore, it is important that all members of the health care team know and champion the benefits of nutrition therapy and key nutrition messages. Nutrition counseling that works toward improving or maintaining glycemic targets, achieving weight management goals, and improving cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., blood pressure, lipids, etc.) within individualized treatment goals is recommended for all adults with diabetes and prediabetes.”\nBut they underline this should be managed care.\n“The American Diabetes Association (ADA) emphasizes that medical nutrition therapy (MNT) is fundamental in the overall diabetes management plan, and the need for MNT should be reassessed frequently by health care providers in collaboration with people with diabetes across the life span, with special attention during times of changing health status and life stages “\nThey recommend use of medical nutritional therapy throughout and defer to #registered-dietician-nutritionist but they avoid “one size fits all” recommendations\nIn the section “Is MNT effective in improving outcomes?” This statement is blunt about nutrition being more effective than currently available medication.\n“Reported hemoglobin A1c (A1C) reductions from MNT can be similar to or greater than what would be expected with treatment using currently available medication for type 2 diabetes (). Strong evidence supports the effectiveness of MNT interventions provided by RDNs for improving A1C, with absolute decreases up to 2.0% (in type 2 diabetes) and up to 1.9% (in type 1 diabetes) at 3–6 months. Ongoing MNT support is helpful in maintaining glycemic improvements ().”\nAnd further along the language is more precise about carbohydrates \u0026ldquo;Reducing overall carbohydrate intake for individuals with diabetes has demonstrated the most evidence for improving glycemia and may be applied in a variety of eating patterns that meet individual needs and preferences.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;For select adults with type 2 diabetes not meeting glycemic targets or where reducing antiglycemic medications is a priority, reducing overall carbohydrate intake with low- or very low-carbohydrate eating plans is a viable approach.\u0026rdquo;\nThey point to two significat randomized controlled trials Dietary Intervention Randomized Controlled Trial (DIRECT) , lasting 2 years showing best #a1c results for the #[[low carb]] group,\nThe #PREDIMED trial, 4 years, wow, This one was #mediterranean-style-pattern vs #low-fat-pattern , so after 4 years, \u0026ldquo;glycemic management improved and the need for glucose-lowering medications was lower in the Mediterranean eating pattern group\u0026rdquo;\nMore references from that DietDoctor article ( from here )\n\u0026ldquo;Effect of a very low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet vs recommended diets in patients with type 2 diabetes: a meta-analysis\u0026rdquo; From here, this is a good #meta-analysis review from #2022 of 8 #randomized-controlled-trial.\nThe #ketogenic-diet showed much greater reduction in #a1c after 6 months.\nAnd “It was superior in decreasing triglyceride levels, increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and reducing the use of antidiabetic medications for up to 12 months.”\nBut it seems they say the benefit disappears after 12 years and they attribute to reduction in diet adherence #adherence to #restriction #[[low carb]]\nReversal and remission Going back to the ADA report, here is their synthesis about remission From the section, \u0026ldquo;What is the role of weight loss on potential for type 2 diabetes remission?\u0026rdquo;\nBasically \u0026ldquo;remission\u0026rdquo;, divided into \u0026ldquo;complete remission\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;partial remission\u0026rdquo;, is defined by these two trials as the maintenance of earlier glycemic levels without diabetic medication for at least a year.\nThe Look AHEAD trial (177) and the Diabetes Remission Clinical Trial (DiRECT) (138) highlight the potential for type 2 diabetes remission—defined as the maintenance of euglycemia (complete remission) or prediabetes level of glycemia (partial remission) with no diabetes medication for at least 1 year (177,178)—in people undergoing weight loss treatment. In the Look AHEAD trial, when compared with the control group, the intensive lifestyle arm resulted in at least partial diabetes remission in 11.5% of participants as compared with 2% in the control group (177). The DiRECT trial showed that at 1 year, weight loss associated with the lifestyle intervention resulted in diabetes remission in 46% of participants (138). Remission rates were related to magnitude of weight loss, rising progressively from 7% to 86% as weight loss at 1 year increased from \u0026lt;5% to ≥15% (138). Diet composition may also play a role; in an RCT by Esposito et al. (179), despite only a 2-kg difference in weight loss, the group following a low-carbohydrate Mediterranean-style eating pattern (see Table 3) experienced greater rates of at least partial diabetes remission, with rates of 14.7% at year 1 and 5% at year 6 compared with 4.7% and 0%, respectively, in the group following a low-fat eating plan.\n","permalink":"https://michal.piekarczyk.xyz/post/2023-05-20-diabetes/","summary":"TLDR Diabetes is what happens when high blood sugar wreaks havoc on the body because either with type I diabetes, the pancreas cannot produce insulin for various reasons or with type II diabetes, no matter how much insulin the pancreas produces, it is not enough insulin to meet the high levels of blood sugar because of insulin resistance (insulin is ignored by cells and blood sugar is not taken up).

This started out as deduping photos and splitting out the photos of food, but at some point I realized I have so many photos I take as notes, taking those out by hand was getting tedious. I used this as an opportunity to test chat GPT\u0026rsquo;s code-generating skills.\nBasically, I asked for a web interface around a flask app to help me out. Here was my prompt\ncan you please write a minimal simple python flask web app called \u0026ldquo;app.py\u0026rdquo; that will read a folder on my laptop that contains image files and has a simple REST API interface where GET will return the filename of a single image as json, say \u0026lsquo;{\u0026ldquo;filename\u0026rdquo;: \u0026ldquo;some_file.jpg\u0026rdquo;}\u0026rsquo; and a POST will take a json input with a filename key and choice key for example like \u0026lsquo;{\u0026ldquo;filename\u0026rdquo;: \u0026ldquo;some_file.jpg\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;choice\u0026rdquo;: \u0026ldquo;some_choice\u0026rdquo;}\u0026rsquo; and the \u0026ldquo;app.py\u0026rdquo; will move \u0026ldquo;some_file.jpg\u0026rdquo; into another folder named \u0026ldquo;some_choice\u0026rdquo;. And then please create a minimal single page html5 app called \u0026ldquo;choose_front_end.html\u0026rdquo; that can interact with the REST API of the flask app \u0026ldquo;app.py\u0026rdquo; previously described using the REST API GET and POST interface. I want to be able to open the \u0026ldquo;choose_front_end.html\u0026rdquo; in my web browser and have the GET API be called on \u0026ldquo;app.py\u0026rdquo; and I want to see the next image to get displayed and I want to be able to write into a text box a choice and I want then that choice that I write to be submitted as part of a POST to \u0026ldquo;app.py\u0026rdquo; . I want to be able to run both the flask \u0026ldquo;app.py\u0026rdquo; and the \u0026ldquo;choose_front_end.html\u0026rdquo; locally on my laptop on localhost.\nAnd the response was pretty cool, with an app.py and choose_front_end.html like I asked,\nalong with some helpful instructions on how to use this more or less.\nHowever, when I started test driving this, I realized some initial issues. First I noticed actually perhaps because of the output size limitations of the free version, the choose_front_end.html file was actually cut off in the middle, so I got the displayNextImage func but the submitChoice func was without a body.\nI also started testing out just the GET part since I did have the full app.py of the flask app, however this did not run because yea of course CORS was not setup here. And CORS is one of those notoriously difficult pieces of boilerplate to setup in any client server application communication even if you are just debugging something locally on your laptop.\nAccess to fetch at \u0026#39;http://127.0.0.1:5000/\u0026#39; from origin \u0026#39;null\u0026#39; has been blocked by CORS policy: No \u0026#39;Access-Control-Allow-Origin\u0026#39; header is present on the requested resource. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request\u0026#39;s mode to \u0026#39;no-cors\u0026#39; to fetch the resource with CORS disabled. I had setup CORS within many web frameworks in the past but I have trouble with this every time. But after a bit of troubleshooting, I stumbled upon the fact that flask actually has some built-in CORS functionality syntactic sugar and I took advantage of that nicely!\nIf you pip install, pip install flask-cors, you can basically do the CORS part with the few additional lines at the top here, from flask_cors import CORS app = Flask(\u0026#34;blah\u0026#34;) CORS(app) @app.route(\u0026#34;/\u0026#34;, methods=[\u0026#34;GET\u0026#34;]) def get_image(): return make_response({\u0026#34;blah\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;blah\u0026#34;}) def make_response(data): str_payload = json.dumps(data) mimetype = \u0026#34;application/json\u0026#34; response = flask.Response(response=str_payload, status=200, mimetype=mimetype) # response.headers[\u0026#34;Access-Control-Allow-Origin\u0026#34;] = \u0026#34;*\u0026#34; # CORS_ORIGIN_ALLOW_ALL = True? # response.headers[\u0026#34;Content-Type\u0026#34;] = \u0026#34;application/json\u0026#34; return response Ultimately after building out a good bit of functionality additional I did not realize I also wanted, I ended up with a solution I was able to run from my laptop and access from my ipad, for convenience, Definitely skipped a lot of details here!

(corollary throw away the to do list and keep the calendar ) Make time for strategic thinking, (aka 50,000 foot thinking ), to \u0026ldquo;reflect and refine\u0026rdquo;, are you really really really doing what you intend? Really though? Are your actions congruent with your intentions? Or are you letting some other random human plan your day or worse yet, is it just pure chaos? Think critically once a week say. The environment has always had distractions, and it may seem like it’s always getting harder to resist. (Do Young minds have it worse today? What does author believe? ) The chapter 7 on going deep too makes it interesting, really vibes with me Impact (TODO: rearrange this section, since lot of impact is still scattered below)\nAlso chapter 8, how finite willpower is a made up thing , super interesting , have not heard it before. Forest app Thoughts, questions [[you are not your khakis]] Thinking haha just like [[Fight club]] [[You are not your thoughts]]\nWhen it comes to values, I still think the [[closed-door-open-door]] is relevant also [[teamwork is dream work]] , [[motivated-by-helping]] , [[Creativity]] , [[spark-joy]] , these are at conflict with [[traction]] , and maybe [[explore-exploit-balance]] can help\n[[Apr 1st, 2023]] , recently I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking about the [[gamification vs going deep]] angle. In particular, I think [[stress]] from [[performing under stress and duress]] and from [[Andrew Huberman]] episode on [[The Power of Play]], so to me this is not just that you can have [[fun-factor]] by [[deep-work]] , also probably the opposite [[shallow-vs-going-deep]] [[shallow work]] and maybe any kinds of [[shallow]] anything is even painful to some degree because it is a [[wasting-time]] and not in the [[low stakes]] kind with [[play]]. collapsed:: true\nI relate how [[Andrew Huberman]] was saying that [[play]] is [[Homeostatic regulation]], per here , this is what [[The Sims]] exhibit with their six core needs bars, and other than \u0026ldquo;social\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;bladder\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;hunger\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;sleep\u0026rdquo; , \u0026ldquo;cleanliness\u0026rdquo;, the sixth the had was \u0026ldquo;fun\u0026rdquo;. Indeed I wonder although [[Andrew Huberman]] doesn\u0026rsquo;t discuss it directly, I wonder if just like [[adenosine-sleep-pressure]] is a thing, (and [[hunger]] [[signaling]] like [[leptin]] is associated with [[energy homeostasis]] ) is there some similar chemical signaling with [[play]] and [[having fun]]? So my main thought is are we doing work all wrong ? I was recently part of a [[hackathon]] at my company where in that [[low stakes]] environment, yes my colleagues and I produced some really cool work, and we were [[having fun]] and of course [[teamwork is dream work]], but later on company wide we were all celebrating the amazing results all the teams produced, but ultimately as a organization, no one really knows how to harness fun and play so that conversation is going nowhere. My overall industry is currently in its \u0026ldquo;lets explore agile\u0026rdquo; [[agile]] phase , which is the exact opposite of fun.\nSome talk about real agile vs [[fake-agile]] or how agile causes [[MVP syndrome]] but no matter how you slice it, haha pun intended 😀 I think agile is a [[fun killer]], a [[downer]], because ultimately it tries to [[bottle excitement]] and [[defer]] it.\nThat is like a [[opiate of the masses]] maybe like in the [[movie-type]] [[Network 1976 movie]] [[Stephen Wolfram]] and his take on [[energy-draining-vs-energy-adding-activity]]. And the whole [[996]], and [[Meritocray Trap book]]\n[[explore-exploit-balance]] is the topic that comes to my mind whenever I feel perhaps I\u0026rsquo;m going down a [[rabbit hole]] or that I risk not creating something [[live in production]] , [[deliver working software frequently]] [[continuous delivery]] [[iterative]] style\nThat [[strategic-thinking]], section, was from \u0026ldquo;chapter 9\u0026rdquo;, and [[implementation-intention]] \u0026ldquo;Traction draws you toward what you want in life, while distraction pulls you away\u0026rdquo; (chapter 9)\nSo well put, however I realize often times what floods my mind can also be other things that I want that are simply unrelated to the thing that I want that I am doing at the present moment 😀. For this reason I really appreciate having [[log-seq]] in my personal life and [[org-mode]] and [[Org Roam]] on [[Doom Emacs]] at my work laptop. Because this lets me effortlessly write a quick note into my [[second-brain]] [[cultivating a digital knowledge garden]] , without really getting too off track with my task at hand. If we internally feel we are [[ignoring something important]] that is nagging at us, that will prevent us from being [[being present]] He was saying this requires [[CalendarTechnique]] [[calendar as your lash]] split your time across your life domains [[core values]] in a way that feels [[congruent]] with your [[intention]]. [[reflect]], [[reflect and refine]] specifically he was saying to book time on your calendar specifically to ask yourself, how did the week go? Did I get distracted? Maybe I wrote in my [[distraction tracker]]?\n\u0026ldquo;Approach the exercise of making a schedule as a curious scientist, rather than a drill sergeant, gives us the freedom to get better with each iteration\u0026rdquo; (page 58, chapter 9)\nthe [[emptying your mind]] like [[Naval Ravikant]] with [[inbox-zero-for-your-mind]]. Always feels great. And you can even burn it after if you want 😅, part of the point is to reduce stress. the relationship between [[Clarity of purpose]] [[meaning of life]], [[meaningful-life]] [[finding my meaning]] [[my values]] . think relates to [[Oliver Burkeman]] and his [[Four Thousand Weeks book]] because he had the notion that people use [[productivity]] to [[Work hard play hard]] [[I Do Coke song]] by [[Feed Me]] and trying to [[time management]] but that haha [[Time Management for Mortals]] , time will do what it wants, My critiques I think the Marshmellow Experiment gives the wrong direction The author recommends Surfing the Urge for ten minutes say before giving in to some desire. I like that he\u0026rsquo;s discussing this and yea I agree it is good to practice impulse control. However, I think surfing the urge can just end up training yourself for \u0026ldquo;delayed gratification\u0026rdquo; as opposed to what you really want which is not to delay but to just allow the urge to pass all together. And in the other section I think with Dr Brickman, he does talk about just placing the urges aka internal triggers, on leaves on a stream. And leaning in to them, actually focusing on them rather than ignoring them. I have been trying to incorporate this and I like it. I agree \u0026ldquo;surfing the urge\u0026rdquo; is most likely not meant to be synonymous with \u0026ldquo;delayed gratification\u0026rdquo; though. The idea is to really intend to watch the urge subside, go away. But if you do not succeed, then don\u0026rsquo;t beat yourself up over it. This requires practice! I like the Joel Goldstein metaphore of this being like lifting weights at the gym and each time you challenge an internal trigger you are doing a rep ! I feel like there is a lot about [[collaborate with multiple people at work]], that can be said, which is maybe not the direct subject of the book, but is really important . I think at this point the dilema is [[closed-door-open-door]] as described by [[richard hamming]] in his [[Richard Hamming turing award lecture]] or at least one of his lectures I recall learning about this from. We need to guard our time and we need the opportunity to think things through carefully, and we can also make room for [[collaboration-opportunity]]. I think one answer I like is [[person Cal Newport]] [[Time block planner]] and more or less be open to [[collaboration-opportunity]], checking the [[Slack]] in between [[focused]] blocks of time like [[Forest pomodoro app]]. And I want to keep practicing getting better at the [[NoEstimates]] approach, given a section of time, cut down the scope to [[if it fits it ships box]] [[ship working software]] basically.\nQuotes \u0026ldquo;If we chronically neglect our values, we become something we\u0026rsquo;re not proud of our lives feel out of balance and diminished. Ironically, this ugly feeling makes us more likely to seek distractions to escape our dissatisfaction with. out actually solving the problem.\u0026rdquo; (chapter 9)\nif I know how you spend your time, then I know what might become of you. (Wolfgang von Goethe , chapter 9)\n\u0026ldquo;Traction draws you toward what you want in life, while distraction pulls you away\u0026rdquo; (chapter 9)\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a curious truth that when you gently pay attention to negative emotions, they tend to dissipate but positive ones expand.\u0026rdquo; (Oliver Burke-man wrote in the Guardian, chapter 6)\nActionable items [[choose your own adventure]] as a way of life Identify internal triggers, possibly using a Distraction Journal. And planning, very much like Cal Newport\u0026rsquo;s Time Block Planning ! At least once daily and hopefully once weekly, do strategic thinking, the 50,000 foot view, reflecting and adjusting. The various breathing like [[Physiological sigh]] I think are highly related to this too , because you can get [[burnout]] stuck in the [[get-lost-in-the-weeds]], lost the [[big-picture]]. And especially [[stress eating]] if [[working long hours]] I like the idea that in order to even have room for some strategic thinking though, you need to be in tune with the parts of your life that you care about. So you need to pay attention In a very stoic way, lean in to your worst internal triggers and practice watching them disappear.

The first plot I did looks like\nbut maybe it is a bit noisy since it has all the data for each day, so trying also a 7 day average too,\nAlso tried , 7 day sum too, So What happened? Well the whole reason I started looking at all this was that I started a Work From Home job in December 2021 and although prior to that, I used to bike-commute to work every day, now bike rides in 2022 I admit have been way shorter, say, 3 to 6 miles a day as opposed to 12+ miles a day.\nAnd alarmingly I saw my weight go up in 2022, perhaps similar to what I recall Iñigo San-Millán described in this interview, https://peterattiamd.com/inigosanmillan/ with Peter Attia , about cyclists who reduce their cycling without reducing their calorie intake.\nOf course I was nowhere near a professional cyclist and I\u0026rsquo;m sure the weight gain is related to a lack of stress management to a large extent, but nevertheless, basically starting 2023, every other day, I aimed for a lower amount of calories.\nThe first plot above does not show this very well, but the second chart, which takes 7-day averages, hopefully does a better job.\nThere are also other behavior changes I\u0026rsquo;m trying too that are not being plotted here, including the replacement of highly processed food with slightly less processed food and also improving the overall protein to energy ratio.\nHow to generate these plots?

I read that style is not data on mozilla that as a history lesson haha, using tables for layout is a thing of the past. Okay maybe that is why it broke?\nI read here about adding\nlayouts/shortcodes/column.html \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;col-md\u0026#34;\u0026gt;{{ .Inner }}\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; layouts/shortcodes/row.html \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;row\u0026#34;\u0026gt;{{ .Inner }}\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; and\n{{\u0026lt; row \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; column \u0026gt;}} something1 {{\u0026lt; /column \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; column \u0026gt;}} something1 {{\u0026lt; /column \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; column \u0026gt;}} something1 {{\u0026lt; /column \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; /row \u0026gt;}} to do this job, but that did not work. And I suspected it was because I did not have row and col-md css classes defined anywhere. So I copied some interesting looking css from here ,\n.row { display: -webkit-box; display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; } .col-md { flex-basis: 0; -webkit-box-flex: 1; flex-grow: 1; max-width: 100%; } I tested this locally and it worked nicely.\nBut how to persist the style? So Hugo uses git submodules for themes. Before, I was using the ananke theme, but I did not make any customizations to the css.\nAnd now I git clone -d from here and according to\nthe faq on PaperMod, to update the css, one can do that with\n.(site root) ├── config.yml ├── content/ ├── theme/hugo-PaperMod/ └── assets/ └── css/ └── extended/ \u0026lt;--- ├── custom_css1.css \u0026lt;--- └── any_name.css \u0026lt;--- but for some reason the style on my custom branch was not taking when I published to github.io .\nI think that is because somewhere in there only the master branch was getting freshly pulled through Github Actions, so I forked https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod, made the custom css updates in my fork, and that did the trick for me.\nCode wrapping! I did not mention this above yet but actually my first custom css that I needed in hugo-PaperMod was the use of\ncode { white-space: pre-wrap !important; } which I had read about on stackoverflow, earlier as the solution with the most votes.\nThe lack of code wrapping had been bugging me for over a year and now with this simple custom css it was a reality!! Finally you don\u0026rsquo;t need to endlessly scroll horizontally to actually read the code in a blog post.\n","permalink":"https://michal.piekarczyk.xyz/post/2023-03-18-hugo-columns-papermod-migrate-theme/","summary":"Quick note, I had moved to the PaperMod theme last month and have been slowly fixing a few things that borked.

And it looked like only “all-MiniLM-L12-v2” appeared to have some kind of [[medical-condition]] knowledge .\n[[Jul 6th, 2023]] , can I do a #[[supervised fine-tuning]] #[[my first]] , collapsed:: true yea so just starting , going through , between https://www.sbert.net/docs/training/overview.html and [[article/Train and Fine-Tune Sentence Transformers Models]]\n08:35 so yea if a particular out of the box model uses [[average-pooling]] then for sure that yells at me that [[stop-words]] should be removed hmm 08:39 ACtually looking at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?search=job and hmm I do see job related datasets. Maybe there are some relevant ones !? How about, say, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/niyamatalmass/google-job-skills , obtained by way of #selenium . Ok cool so this gives me hope that maybe in the future I can pull some more posts in the future, hopefully [[web-scrape]] is still possible later. 08:55 ok that is actually pretty decent, looking at the \u0026ldquo;job_skills.csv\u0026rdquo; . Some nice jargon in there ! 09:04 ok so of the 4 dataset cases in https://huggingface.co/blog/how-to-train-sentence-transformers , I think makes most sense to use Case 2, where instead of assigning a number from 0 to 1 for similarity, I can just choose sentences that. I feel are similar to beuild a dataset. These are \u0026ldquo;positive pairs\u0026rdquo; [[positive pair]] So https://huggingface.co/datasets/embedding-data/sentence-compression here is a reference example that uses this. #[[Lossy compression]] perhaps . Kind of cool since yea #summarization-task is kind of this. Some details are missed yes but get the main idea #TLDR . I see pretty simple, each row is a json looking pair. Ah ok [[json lines]] right. Learned about this from [[Michael Light]]. https://jsonlines.org/examples/ nice. 09:13 ok so I can write some dataset building code like this,\nfrom sentence_transformers import InputExample from torch.utils.data import DataLoader train_examples = [] dataset = read_json_lines(...) for i, x in enumerate(dataset): s1, s2 = x train_examples.append( InputExample(texts=[s1, s2])) train_dataloader = DataLoader( train_examples, shuffle=True, batch_size=16) feels like I should use my [[my projects/personal/manage-my-photos]] labeler to help me kind of somewhat quickly build some labels.

particular word is not recognized in the vocabulary, it just gets split up into stuff that is known or the ## is used perhaps to create some kinds of smaller #subword-tokenization . I was reading the documentation of that tokenizer and found this section, #+BEGIN_QUOTE\nis_split_into_words (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`): Whether or not the input is already pre-tokenized (e.g., split into words). If set to `True`, the tokenizer assumes the input is already split into words (for instance, by splitting it on whitespace) which it will tokenize. This is useful for NER or token classification. #+END_QUOTE which I think is pretty cool, referring to #[[Named Entity Recognition NER]] , used with this, 09:41 next ok yea thinking would love to inform this model of the entities, vocabulary t hat is missing.\n[[Jul 12th, 2023]] ok started building up code to capture a mini corpus, of the sentences, which have words that are not part of the vocabulary, collapsed:: true 08:17 [[my projects/personal/langchain-interview-me-2023-feb]]\n09:05 ok wow organized earlier notes a bit ! So should I therefore, collect the sentences that have the no hits and at least see what happens if I fine tune with those, if the new #sentence-transformers model has the new vocabulary ? ok, so to build a corpus, thinking for each sentence in this dataset I am working with right now, if I tokenize it using the AutoTokenizer from 'sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2' , and the output does not include my desired tokens or tokens prefixed with ## but the sentence does have the words in question visible in plain text, then that sentence is a candidate for the fine tuning set I think ! 09:16 Also I just glanced through what this out put, looks like,\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\u0026#39;sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2\u0026#39;) vocabulary = tokenizer.get_vocab() print(vocabulary.keys()) And I don\u0026rsquo;t see anything upper case so pretty sure I can stick to lower case ! So first the slower way, and maybe I can find a faster #PyTorch way later, 09:34 ok drafting this on the side still. but high level concept yea, find sentences that have the one or more of the desired terms in plain text, that actually might be good enough, as long as I have checked indeed the words are no hits against the model vocabulary but can also tokenize such sentences and verify that the expected tokens do not exist 09:36 have a high level #question though, per #subword-tokenization how do you contain #[[Named Entity Recognition NER]] concepts if they can end up being broken up? #card Like even in the example in https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter2/4?fw=pt#tokenization , somehow \u0026ldquo;transformer\u0026rdquo;

Otherwise, without that, I\u0026rsquo;m curious what would the output vector , embedding, even look like for sentences with those new words? Like a undefined error? or like a equivalent of a zero vector ? 09:03 ok wow so the answer is in their nice course here, chapter 6 , on training [[tokenizer]] [[train new tokenizer from an old one]] So funny enough, the example being used here is [[code understanding]] , [[source code embedding]] and so this dataset is used, to update the tokenizer of gpt-2,\nraw_datasets = load_dataset(\u0026#34;code_search_net\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;python\u0026#34;) from transformers import AutoTokenizer old_tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\u0026#34;gpt2\u0026#34;) tokenizer = old_tokenizer.train_new_from_iterator(training_corpus, 52000) fastinating side note mentioned here is that there are tokenizers that can be written in python, which are slow and also can be written in #Rust-lang and also #cuda . hmm so ok then you can save that tokenizer,\ntokenizer.save_pretrained(\u0026#34;code-search-net-tokenizer\u0026#34;) but how about updating the original model then ? 09:21 ok well conceptually, skipping ahead in the [[hugging face]] course there, I see here in chapter 7, that you can use a Trainer from\nfrom transformers import Trainer in order to fine tune a model and pass a tokenizer as an input, So per above I suspect that is the answer to my question!\nSo thinking about next steps Ok so a conceptual update here, I think maybe I need to hunt down some datasets or build a dataset which has additional technical language, and then use that to fine tune a tokenizer, and not just add vocabulary to it with tokenizer.add_tokens haha that was not a full answer. Yea and then I would need to use some of the tips in chapter 6 and 7 of the [[hugging face]] course to fine tune a model but a sentence transformer model say, with the tokenizer that I updated.\n[[Jul 18th, 2023]] reading more about subword tokenization and purpose of tokenizer tuning collapsed:: true not sure if my use case where technical terms are lacking from a tokenizer warrants this but maybe 09:07 So then I\u0026rsquo;m not sure why the https://huggingface.co/blog/how-to-train-sentence-transformers method I used earlier for fine tuning, earlier here the other day , did not update the vocabulary. ,\n09:13 Hmm ok maybe the explanation they give up front here helps to confirm that fine tuning a transformer model will not update the tokenizer. My impression is that fine tuning a transformer model is really just going to update the weights and since we know that many transformer models use [[subword-tokenization]], although you have new words, the fine tuning weight adjustments are made off of the subword tokens that are less meaningful than if they had concepts mapped out for those new words Although I am also slightly getting the impression that training a tokenizer is less about vocabulary and more about like #grammar because in their phrasing they refer not to the differences in the vocabulary between #English and #Japanese but to the differences in punctuation . And they are fine tuning a tokenizer on [[source code]] which definitely has different #grammar . 09:26 yea and additionally here they spell out that [[train new tokenizer from an old one]] is really about deciding what are good [[subword-tokenization]] to use, actually what sub-words. hmm But a tokenizer does indeed have a vocabulary so hmm, is my problem a tokenizer vocabulary problem or is it really I should be looking at this as a [[Named Entity Recognition NER]] problem ?\nbut yea next should try, 09:32 anyway I should still just try this,\nso next let me apply the mini corpus I had from last time, to this, and lets see what the new tokenizer does\ntokenizer = old_tokenizer.train_new_from_iterator(training_corpus, 52000) [[Jul 19th, 2023]] Ran the tokenizer fine tuning with a small dataset The vocabulary of the output of train_new_from_iterator had only the new data. So \u0026ldquo;mission accomplished\u0026rdquo; haha I got the new vocabulary in there but at the cost of missing the original vocabulary 😅\nTrying this out collapsed:: true so let\u0026rsquo;s follow along per hugging face nlp chapter 6 ,\n09:23 what does the data they are passing in for their use case look like?\nfrom datasets import load_dataset # This can take a few minutes to load, so grab a coffee or tea while you wait! raw_datasets = load_dataset(\u0026#34;code_search_net\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;python\u0026#34;) training_corpus = ( raw_datasets[\u0026#34;train\u0026#34;][i : i + 1000][\u0026#34;whole_func_string\u0026#34;] for i in range(0, len(raw_datasets[\u0026#34;train\u0026#34;]), 1000) ) ok haha I don\u0026rsquo;t want to download the whole thing because I am using a laptop tethered to my phone [[phone-tether]] #moment/haha . But I can just look at it online, https://huggingface.co/datasets/code_search_net , per the above, each row is a record and \u0026ldquo;whole_func_string\u0026rdquo; is a string of the function definition. So their training_corpus data would look like a list of strings basically. Ok let me repurpose my mini [[positive pair]] dataset from earlier for this then,\nimport os import json import utils as u from functools import reduce from pathlib import Path path = (Path(os.getenv(\u0026#34;REPOS_DIR\u0026#34;)) / \u0026#34;data\u0026#34; / \u0026#34;kaggle-google-job-skills/2023-07-15-positive-pairs.jsonl\u0026#34;) \u0026#34;2023-07-15-positive-pairs.jsonl\u0026#34; training_corpus = list(set( reduce( lambda x, y: x + y, [json.loads(x)[\u0026#34;set\u0026#34;] for x in Path(path).read_text().splitlines()] ) )) 09:40 ok so the second argument to\ntrain_new_from_iterator is the vocab_size .

[[why a custom tokenizer]]\nPerson with this medium post, is also under the impression that a custom tokenizer [[tokenizer]] is useful as a way of focusing on your unique vocabulary,\nour domain is very specific, words and concepts about clothes, shapes, colors, … Therefore, we are interested in defining our own tokenizer created from our specific vocabulary, avoiding including more common words from other domains or use cases that are irrelevant for our final purpose. 10:13 ok reading, here for some more detail, So the focus around tokenizing\n\u0026#34;Don\u0026#39;t you love 🤗 Transformers? We sure do.\u0026#34; w.r.t. [\u0026quot;Don't\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;you\u0026quot;,] versus [\u0026quot;Don\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;'\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;t\u0026quot;] versus [\u0026quot;Do\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;n't\u0026quot;] does hint that yes you do want to help extract units of meaning, And they say that yes you ideally want a smaller vocabulary size to help constrain computation, but using say [[character tokenization]] although ends up w/ a small vocabulary, will be less expressive and capturing the meaning of words will be more difficult. Feels like in the case of jargon words, like #acronym or just brand new words like \u0026ldquo;Tensorflow\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;pytorch\u0026rdquo; , I can see sometimes subword tokenization will be helpful, since say it would be great if the word \u0026ldquo;tensor\u0026rdquo; was tokenized as meaningfully related to \u0026ldquo;tensorflow\u0026rdquo;, similarly between \u0026ldquo;pytorch\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;python\u0026rdquo;. And I get that if you are using a subword tokenizer with a good bit of language as a input, then you should have enough to prevent the [[out-of-vocabulary-words-OOV]] misses , 10:51 Also they describe the example of BertTokenizer tokenizing an acronym it has not seen,\nfrom transformers import BertTokenizer tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained(\u0026#34;bert-base-uncased\u0026#34;) tokenizer.tokenize(\u0026#34;I have a new GPU!\u0026#34;) [\u0026#34;i\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;have\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;a\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;new\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;gp\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;##u\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;!\u0026#34;] And they only mention the benefit, of not having the vocabulary miss, but no mention of the meaning of the concept of #GPU getting missed . Oh and they explain that the #double-hashtag allows tokenization to be reversible since now you know to re-attach the subwords. But not every tokenizer is reversible I think. Or at least not every tokenizer has the same syntax, since they point out , the use of the underscore _ instead, in XLNetTokenizer\nfrom transformers import XLNetTokenizer tokenizer = XLNetTokenizer.from_pretrained(\u0026#34;xlnet-base-cased\u0026#34;) tokenizer.tokenize(\u0026#34;Don\u0026#39;t you love 🤗 Transformers?

So I am leaning more that this is about the statistics of your text data as it relates to allowing language models to extract meaning , but without being a performance burden. 12:36 continue reading there, see if I missed something, collapsed:: true Ah interesting so per here, the [[vocabulary size]] is a hyper parameter, that is like a ceiling for splitting words, so if when just say space-splitting, we have too many words, then we split until the vocabulary size is under the input there. collapsed:: true But I know per my earlier attempt, yesterday, where I provided ,\ntokenizer = old_tokenizer.train_new_from_iterator(training_corpus, 52000) I ended up with python In [278]: tokenizer.vocab_size Out[278]: 601 and still I had quite a lot of [[subword-tokenization]] going on, so there are other details looks like. So at least the [[byte-pair encoding]] #algorithm-type , will start with a base vocabulary which consists of just the characters. collapsed:: true 12:51 ok actually glad I kept reading this is interesting, so this algo, will iteratively, find the most frequent symbol pair, adding the merger to its vocabulary, then finding the next most frequent symbol pair after that. So symbols start out as just letters, but after one iteration, a symbol would consist of two characters together. And larger clumps can form after that. So their example, started out with space split words with frequencies,\n(\u0026#34;hug\u0026#34;, 10), (\u0026#34;pug\u0026#34;, 5), (\u0026#34;pun\u0026#34;, 12), (\u0026#34;bun\u0026#34;, 4), (\u0026#34;hugs\u0026#34;, 5) and starting with a base vocabulary of\n[\u0026#34;b\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;g\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;h\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;n\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;p\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;s\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;u\u0026#34;] and after performing three merges, having a vocabulary of\n[\u0026#34;b\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;g\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;h\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;n\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;p\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;s\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;u\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;ug\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;un\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;hug\u0026#34;] and at that point they showed that the original set of words and their frequencies would be represented as\n(\u0026#34;hug\u0026#34;, 10), (\u0026#34;p\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;ug\u0026#34;, 5), (\u0026#34;p\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;un\u0026#34;, 12), (\u0026#34;b\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;un\u0026#34;, 4), (\u0026#34;hug\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;s\u0026#34;, 5) and that a new test word like \u0026quot;mug\u0026quot; say would end up getting represented as [\u0026quot;\u0026lt;unk\u0026gt;\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ug\u0026quot;], since for this case \u0026quot;m\u0026quot; just was not part of the initial vocabulary. 13:10 and ultimately the size of the vocabulary for a tokenizer, [[vocabulary size]] will be the size of the base vocabulary plus the number of merges before it was decided to stop . And clearly, haha we can have some absurd algorithm implementation that never stops and we end up with a vocabulary that includes all the full words that were encountered, and then therefore we would get fewer computational benefits . 13:21 ok so [[why a custom tokenizer]], in the video link #video-type, embedded in chapter 6 link, the lean is now to yes train a tokenizer from scratch if there is new jargon yes as in a new \u0026ldquo;domain\u0026rdquo; , #card So high level four good reasons, for [[why a custom tokenizer]] [[derive-from-scratch]] #card new language, new characters ( with accents) new domain (medical, technical, legal) new style (haha like [[Old English]] or [[Old French]] ) #take-away ohhh and #moment/aha a really good example is explained that a tokenizer unfamiliar with a #corpus will excessively split and that is not good because #[[input sequence]] is limited [[context-window]] [[maximum-context-size]] ! And so you will risk not capturing the full sentence you want to pass to a #LLM . Nice. Excessive tokenizer splitting, can impact model performance, too, #question #card , why though? Maybe the argument is similar to like \u0026ldquo;\u0026rdquo; those unknowns, in that there is less information being captured. My intuitive reasoning is that tiny subwords embedding representations will be likely meaningless . The #attention will get thrown off by basically letter chunks that will end up being as common as the word \u0026ldquo;the\u0026rdquo; , so perhaps you will have just #stop-words at that point with low information. Example of this particular model tokenizer missing a lot of #unicode characters from [[Bangla]] #language-type . And yea [[out-of-vocabulary-words-OOV]] \u0026ldquo;\u0026rdquo; , has no useful information for the model to use there. And [[excessive splitting by tokenizer]] , for say #[[biomedical Glossary]] And for the other example given, of using code-search-net python dataset to train a tokenizer, I like the question that gets asked is [[performance-lift]] at least eye-balling. And in below example, she does show it is desirable to capture a concept as one token, but I think this will ultimately only happen if that example is more frequent , relative to other patterns when doing merges per [[byte-pair encoding]] [[Jul 21st, 2023]] mainly just brief thoughts about building a new dataset Thinking next I should look through various datasets out there , and choose which would have good english language breadth but also depth into the technical jargon world.\nSo for sure a dataset from job descriptions from that nice #Kaggle data. , https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/niyamatalmass/google-job-skills?resource=download maybe there are others like that , but for sure I think this is something that would need to be updated at least once or twice a year because technical terms change frequently 09:29 side note this very much feels like a [[data-drift]] problem but feels like [[nlp-drift]]\n[[Jul 22nd, 2023]] one brief look model card for, 'sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2' Think I am seeing that this model did not update the tokenizer of the pretrained model that it fine tuned. So what are the dataset sources in 'sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2' which has been my goto model recently.\nSo per https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 here, haha there are a billion sentence tuples in there haha. Not sure how easy it will be to perform the same fine tuning steps, but maybe the tokenizer step requires way less data. 13:31 So next want to answer yea what data was used for the tokenizer there. Ok so looking at https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2/blob/main/train_script.py the train_script.py in there, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t look like they modified the tokenizer that was from the pre-trained model, given as an input at the bottom,\n#python train_many_data_files_v2.py --steps 1000000 --batch_size 128 \\ --model nreimers/MiniLM-L6-H384-uncased train_data_configs/all_datasets_v4.json output/all_datasets_v4_MiniLM-L6-H384-uncased-batch128 ok so then perhaps I should look up the card for that then.\n[[Jul 23rd, 2023]] More practical dive today Refreshed my story blurb texts after several months. Pulled another kaggle job description dataset for analysis. And another run of cosine similarity for the corpori corpi (what is plural of corpus haha )\nwrapping up thoughts on tokenizers from other day 09:53 ok two thoughts, so\ncollapsed:: true I can look at nreimers/MiniLM-L6-H384-uncased and if a tokenizer is described there, And I can also look at that chapter 7 fine tuning link that takes a tokenizer passed in . 10:07 I also do want to think more high level, about the overall goal , task and reevaluate approaches. But ok, quick look, of possible, at https://huggingface.co/nreimers/MiniLM-L6-H384-uncased , 10:13 only points to https://huggingface.co/microsoft/MiniLM-L12-H384-uncased but not much else to go on 10:18 and that points to this paper, https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10957 , hmm [[LLM distillation]] with a [[LLM distillation/teacher model and teacher assistant]] 10:28 well looking at their train code in github , it looks like for each teacher assistant model (where the MiniLM on hugging face is one of them) , they appear to use these tokenizers directly,\nfrom transformers import ( BertTokenizer, DistilBertTokenizer, XLMTokenizer, XLMRobertaTokenizer, ) without modification.\nDatasets 10:31 ok hmm think I should define dataset and problem bit more now\ncollapsed:: true ok going back to a core early example, from here , I ran [[cosine similarity]] per [[sentence-transformers]] , let me try it again , ( [[May 28th, 2023]] ) This time with the new dataset I have and maybe I will add another one too.

I want to really answer the question, do I need to do pre-processing, removing [[stop-words]] so the [[sentence-transformers]] [[cosine similarity]] after average pooling does not suffer? And then after doing the preprocessing if necessary , excluding it as an issue or acting to remove stop words or fluff words, then lets run cosine similarity like that. And then maybe a refined , more granular approach would be to think about using [[Named Entity Recognition NER]] maybe to better remove stop words , especially if I do not perhaps have the luxury of fine tuning. but yea side note I think fine tuning would be really helpful to help with embedding these interesting jargon words close to each other if they are indeed related And as a visual debugging I really should plot out or at least someone must have some nice tool to visualize embeddings\n[[Jul 24th, 2023]] started a nice debug session today , false negative analysis here, Ok per my notes from [[Jul 23rd, 2023]], let me hunt down one good [[false negative]],\nFor sure I am realizing yes a lot of my sentences in my personal corpus are lacking a succinctness and there is a lot of filler in there ideally I should cut out.

I noticed since the length of the output was weird especially looking at the [[attention-mask]] . So that attention mask basically was showing that the three sentences being encoded had a final length that was the same number of ids and tokens , both 13, but there were some 0s at the end of some of the sentences. So that ended up being just yet another [PAD] token. Ok so '[CLS] means special #BERT token for start of sequence and [SEP] is the separator between sequences . Yea and [PAD] just says, nothing to do here. And the padding=True option is not about padding up to like [[context-window]] limit, it just says if you are passing multiple sentences to be encoded, to make them all equal length. Anyway 384 is the size of the embedding, in this case, and it is not yet clear to me what is the [[what is relationship between size of input token sequence and dimension of embedding]] , there might be some [[dimensionality reduction]] right. 12:58 so continuing along then, next step was\n#Compute token embeddings with torch.no_grad(): model_output = model(**encoded_input) In [143]: vars(model_output) Out[143]: {\u0026#39;last_hidden_state\u0026#39;: tensor([[[ 0.2913, -0.2685, -0.2250, ..., 0.4261, 0.0493, -0.2095], [-0.6272, -0.0421, -0.2452, ..., 0.5336, 1.3115, 0.5999], [ 0.0023, -0.2805, -0.4198, ..., -0.2900, 1.5808, -0.4912], ..., [ 0.1802, -0.5567, 0.0146, ..., 0.9311, 0.5940, -0.3536], [ 0.0603, -0.2502, 0.5959, ..., 0.9435, 0.9465, -1.0680], [-0.3356, 0.0650, 0.1109, ..., 1.0801, 0.2653, -0.2762]], [[ 0.0856, 0.1876, 0.0488, ..., 0.1204, -0.0907, -0.1662], [ 0.1291, -0.0266, 0.6318, ..., 0.7958, 0.1555, -1.2737], [ 0.0062, 0.2263, 0.1851, ..., 0.3981, 0.6461, -0.2192], ..., [ 0.3036, 0.3740, 0.2523, ..., 0.6319, 0.5731, -0.2901], [-0.2124, 0.2626, 0.6867, ..., 0.5504, 0.7065, -0.4728], [-0.2220, 0.2086, 0.6693, ..., 0.5410, 0.5683, -0.3963]], [[ 0.0464, 0.3381, 0.2082, ..., 0.2766, -0.0861, -0.0358], [ 0.1162, 0.2264, 0.1021, ..., 0.1858, 0.4895, 1.2175], [ 0.1537, 0.1730, 0.5151, ..., 1.3720, 0.3621, 0.5758], ..., [ 0.3883, 0.2813, 0.0309, ..., 0.3264, -0.1039, 0.5856], [ 0.3477, 0.0940, 0.2564, ..., 0.1463, 0.1743, 0.5586], [ 0.1911, -0.0142, 0.3021, ..., 0.1814, 0.2111, 0.2329]]]), \u0026#39;pooler_output\u0026#39;: tensor([[-0.0417, -0.0041, 0.0332, ..., 0.0117, -0.0634, -0.0058], [-0.0227, -0.0248, -0.0112, ..., 0.0482, -0.1108, 0.0122], [-0.0663, 0.0281, 0.0706, ..., 0.0258, -0.0222, -0.0608]]), \u0026#39;hidden_states\u0026#39;: None, \u0026#39;past_key_values\u0026#39;: None, \u0026#39;attentions\u0026#39;: None, \u0026#39;cross_attentions\u0026#39;: None} Ok cool, so seeing each input is embedded separately, we have size of 3 rows here, like 3 input encodings ,\nIn [146]: [model_output.last_hidden_state.shape, model_output.pooler_output.shape] Out[146]: [torch.Size([3, 13, 384]), torch.Size([3, 384])] Hmm and last hidden state, with the 13 wonder if those are 13 [[attention-head]] ?

So the [[subword-tokenization]] clearly I now understand is a statistical procedure unrelated to the #[[supervised fine-tuning]] step and yea likely that the more common sub-words will end up being longer subwords after [[why a custom tokenizer]] , but most likely a concept still gets broken apart, into multiple sub-words, so then ultimately does that not really matter, because upon computing [[cosine similarity]], another sentence which has the same exact [[jargon]] word will be split up in the same way. And maybe even if a model is not #[[supervised fine-tuning]] with a new corpus, we may still benefit from at least words with a common word parts being close dimensionally, right, 18:20 hmm so a dead super simple test, of above sub-word theory,\nmodel_id = \u0026#34;sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2\u0026#34; sentences = [ \u0026#34;python\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;pyspark\u0026#34;, ] embeddings = ut.vec_to_embeddings(model_id, sentences) In [189]: cos_sim(embeddings[0, :], embeddings[1,:]) Out[189]: tensor([[0.4150]]) Ok kind of thought so. 18:47 added one more option for myself there,\nreload(ut) model_id = \u0026#34;sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2\u0026#34; sentences = [ \u0026#34;python\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;pyspark\u0026#34;, ] encoded_input, embeddings = ut.vec_to_embeddings( model_id, sentences, return_tokenizer_output=True) tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id) print(tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(encoded_input.data[\u0026#34;input_ids\u0026#34;][0, :])) print(tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(encoded_input.data[\u0026#34;input_ids\u0026#34;][1, :])) [\u0026#39;[CLS]\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;python\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;[SEP]\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;[PAD]\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;[PAD]\u0026#39;] [\u0026#39;[CLS]\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;p\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;##ys\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;##park\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;[SEP]\u0026#39;] That\u0026rsquo;s terrible haha ok no wonder the cosine similarity is so low, 0.415 haha. 18:51 one more example to try, hmm, this one should be obvious ,\nsentences = [\u0026#34;postgresql\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;database\u0026#34;] encoded_input, embeddings = ut.vec_to_embeddings( model_id, sentences, return_tokenizer_output=True) tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id) print(tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(encoded_input.data[\u0026#34;input_ids\u0026#34;][0, :])) print(tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(encoded_input.data[\u0026#34;input_ids\u0026#34;][1, :])) print(\u0026#34;cosine similarity\u0026#34;, cos_sim(embeddings[0, :], embeddings[1,:])) [\u0026#39;[CLS]\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;post\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;##gre\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;##s\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;##q\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;##l\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;[SEP]\u0026#39;] [\u0026#39;[CLS]\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;database\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;[SEP]\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;[PAD]\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;[PAD]\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;[PAD]\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;[PAD]\u0026#39;] cosine similarity tensor([[0.5301]]) hmm haha thats really bad I think One more\nsentences = [\u0026#34;postgresql\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;sql\u0026#34;] encoded_input, embeddings = ut.vec_to_embeddings( model_id, sentences, return_tokenizer_output=True) tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id) print(tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(encoded_input.data[\u0026#34;input_ids\u0026#34;][0, :])) print(tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(encoded_input.data[\u0026#34;input_ids\u0026#34;][1, :])) print(\u0026#34;cosine similarity\u0026#34;, cos_sim(embeddings[0, :], embeddings[1,:])) [\u0026#39;[CLS]\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;post\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;##gre\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;##s\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;##q\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;##l\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;[SEP]\u0026#39;] [\u0026#39;[CLS]\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;sql\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;[SEP]\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;[PAD]\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;[PAD]\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;[PAD]\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;[PAD]\u0026#39;] cosine similarity tensor([[0.5085]]) hmm yea this is no good.

Maybe for a tokenizer, perhaps I just need to build a dataset that has a good sampling mix of English language and a healthy proportion of technical language. But I think before doing that, I would like to take another stab at understanding, how to answer the more general question, about [[subword-tokenization]] , so for non jargon language, any tokenizer will still end up having plenty of subwords, but they will still end up with good embeddings right? So since subwords are split up into multiple embeddings, then maybe is it that the model just associates those subword embeddings appropriately then?

Should try to do some reading on this .\n[[Aug 3rd, 2023]] trying to do some more research on subword tokenization embedding are sub word token embeddings meaningful? Don\u0026rsquo;t have a definitive answer yet , but played around with the idea So what I wrote down yesterday, let\u0026rsquo;s try to phrase this question , how do subword embedding models capture meaning of concepts that are broken up into parts? [[are sub word token embeddings meaningful?]]\ncollapsed:: true so any tokenizer that uses [[subword-tokenization]], has the benefit of representing a large vocabulary with a subword vocabulary taht is smaller. Not remembering precisely but there are computational benefits to a smaller [[vocabulary size]] . But also with [[byte-pair encoding]] and similar algos, you have fewer [[out-of-vocabulary-words-OOV]] , and that is important since that can have performance degradations, an embedding model literally doesn\u0026rsquo;t know what those inputs mean. collapsed:: true Other benefits of course are it is more resilient to #misspelling , #typographical-error Related question is probably, [[Named Entity Recognition NER]] , [[Named Entity Recognition NER/how does it work across sub word tokenization]] Well realized it is build for this since entities are already often defined across multiple words, so multiple sub-words doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound like a huge stretch . 12:49 I\u0026rsquo;m reading the [[book/Natural Language Processing with Transformers]] chapter 4 , skimming, collapsed:: true one note I had from earlier, building a dataset in this chapter they chose representative sampling by percent data about languages spoken in #switzerland . Kind of cool Cool how on page 89, there is a custom dataset created based on the proportion of languages that are in #switzerland , in this case ,\nlangs = [\u0026#34;de\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;fr\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;it\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;en\u0026#34;] fracs = [0.629, 0.229, 0.084, 0.059] So I can borrow above technique if I would need a dataset that is more jargon heavy. 13:28 hmm but a note on [[why a custom tokenizer]] , collapsed:: true reading on page 35 in [[book/Natural Language Processing with Transformers]] , they are stressing, to use same tokenizer a model was trained with, so yea when creating a new tokenizer, therefore a new model is necessary too, otherwise the token id mappings will be completely off .\n13:38 ultimately, maybe [[are sub word token embeddings meaningful?]]\ncollapsed:: true maybe answer is yes if the [[average-pooling]] of the embeddings of those sub words is meaningful, which is precisely what that mean_pooling function of the [[sentence-transformers]] is doing. uniformly averages all the embeddings. So yea I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be surprised if meaning did have a chance of getting a bit lost.\nSome more reading 14:24 I do want to continue reading some of the tokenizer sections in that book, but let me try to some quick research first.\ncollapsed:: true [[hugging face Datasets]] , a custom dataset, hmm so warming up to this , reading here, for use on a laptop, they support streaming operations, yay so don\u0026rsquo;t have to be a huge memory burden . Nice, they use [[memory mapped file]], wow, so can have like unlimited size then hmm , like magic 15:22 ok stumbled on link this section of the [[hugging face]] nlp course , on [[semantic search]], covering [[average-pooling]] yea. But also [[faiss.ai]] which is the [[Facebook AI Similarity Search FAISS]] which maybe is an alternative library to [[sentence-transformers]]? collapsed:: true 15:30 hmm article link someone hinting that [[Facebook AI Similarity Search FAISS]] is more about indexing and [[sentence-transformers]] more about the embeddings themselves perhaps. So faster lookup, faster search, 15:48 ok what can I learn here then Really not sure though why they are not concerned about removing the [[stop-words]] since they pollute that average . Think I will steal their nice technique for more quickly visualizing similarity though, In video at head of the page , presenter here, characterizes 0.83 as a strong relationship between these sentences. 17:15 I had a sentence here wrote on #ipad but #[[logseq sync]] deleted it [[moment/grr]] [[data loss]]. I wrote that [[hugging face Datasets]] seems to be a #pandas alternative since it has filtering , has maps, and especially w/ the [[memory mapped file]] would be way better than a memory bound pandas dataframe 17:17 seeing a note that the [[symmetric vs asymmetric semantic search]] idea is being discussed here,\nmodel_ckpt = \u0026#34;sentence-transformers/multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1\u0026#34; but honestly I thought since now I know it is all just [[average-pooling]] then what\u0026rsquo;s the point? 17:35 in any case this article uses a new kind of pooling , cls pooling, maybe worth seeing if that is better than average pooling?\ndef cls_pooling(model_output): return model_output.last_hidden_state[:, 0] When I look at this function though, does not make sense because it is just returning the embedding of the [CLS] token, isn\u0026rsquo;t that weird? Wouldn\u0026rsquo;t that be the same vector each time, for the [CLS] token? Ok, try this, so for a bunch of sentences, let\u0026rsquo;s just compare the cosine similarity between the two pooling methods, out of curiosity,\nsentences = [ \u0026#34;postgresql\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;pyspark\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;this couch is for sale\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;docker\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;kubernetes\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;tensorflow\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;pytorch\u0026#34;, ] tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\u0026#34;sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2\u0026#34;) model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(\u0026#34;sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2\u0026#34;) # for sentence in sentences: encoded_input = tokenizer(sentences, padding=True, truncation=True, max_length=128, return_tensors=\u0026#39;pt\u0026#39;) with torch.no_grad(): model_output = model(**encoded_input) [model_output.last_hidden_state.shape, model_output.pooler_output.shape] [torch.Size([7, 7, 384]), torch.Size([7, 384])] sentence_embeddings = mean_pooling(model_output, encoded_input[\u0026#39;attention_mask\u0026#39;]) sentence_embeddings.shape # torch.Size([7, 384]) cls_pooled = ut.cls_pooling(model_output) cls_pooled.shape # torch.Size([7, 384]) extract_scalar = lambda x: round(float(x[0][0]), 3) for i, _ in enumerate(sentence_embeddings): print(sentences[i], \u0026#34;cos_sim,\u0026#34;, extract_scalar(cos_sim(sentence_embeddings[i, :], cls_pooled[i, :])), extract_scalar(cos_sim(sentence_embeddings[i, :], model_output.pooler_output[i, :])), extract_scalar(cos_sim(cls_pooled[i, :], model_output.pooler_output[i, :])), ) postgresql cos_sim, 0.581 0.008 -0.02 pyspark cos_sim, 0.63 0.04 -0.008 this couch is for sale cos_sim, 0.572 -0.041 -0.044 docker cos_sim, 0.686 0.018 -0.066 kubernetes cos_sim, 0.594 -0.068 -0.042 tensorflow cos_sim, 0.563 0.068 -0.016 pytorch cos_sim, 0.567 0.022 0.017 Ok yea so this cls pooling approach, there is some similarity to the average pooling. interesting. But haha the final model_output.pooler_output, yea that is unrelated to anything even though the dimension is the same. Wonder what that is, haha.\nthoughts on a custom dataset 16:09 building my own custom dataset, for the [[supervised fine-tuning]] and for the measuring , can really be the same dataset,\nJust train a test split, so build the [[positive pair]] with lots and lots of organic sentences , that use jargon, yea maybe using the cluster approach I was thinking about earlier, clustering by similar job titles, and maybe at some point I can mix in [[positive pair]] constructed along with my own personal examples.\n[[Aug 4th, 2023]] reading and musing some more on meaning or no meaning with fertile sub-wording tokenization [[are sub word token embeddings meaningful?]]\nSo thinking in context of [[Named Entity Recognition NER/how does it work across sub word tokenization]], I think it is the core #BERT #[[NLP Transformers]] model that is build for understanding #[[input sequence]] and so probably it picks up some cues about multi-token sequences that are entities. But [[sentence-transformers]] is a [[bag-of-words]] so yea it is not tuning anything here right? Because reading , [[book/Natural Language Processing with Transformers]] page 97 , my notes I underlined that yea the [[Named Entity Recognition NER]] task is a [[token classification task]] Wait but then what is happening in the [[article/Train and Fine-Tune Sentence Transformers Models]] ? Yea also reading , page 313, that yes there are metrics specific to tokenizers like [[subword fertility]] which measures average number of subwords coming out of [[subword-tokenization]], but that these are like [[end-to-end-vs-proxy-ML-training]] proxy metrics and instead [[end to end test]] of performance is best. Most direct . Hmm so perhaps yea my focus on things like [[cosine similarity]] is good since it is an end to end measure, but it gives me more reason to build that nice dataset of my own 😀 , [[moment/anticipation]] , [[moment/curiosity]] , 09:29 so yea think would be a useful next mini thing to look at, per link, [[article/Train and Fine-Tune Sentence Transformers Models]], is this fine tuning changing weights actually, somehow helping to build associations around the tokens regardless of whether they are haha highly fertile and possibly meaningless looking [[subword-tokenization]] ? haha Yea and should continue to build out my dataset [[positive pair]] , aspiration, to train test, build and measure !\n[[Aug 6th, 2023]] debugging does fine tuning update model weights? Looks like yes. But a small dataset appears to minimally update weights, which makes sense. 10:06 yea so question from last time, [[article/Train and Fine-Tune Sentence Transformers Models]], what is this actually changing?\nSo earlier I tried this, on [[Jul 15th, 2023]] , here, with this data/kaggle-google-job-skills/2023-07-15-positive-pairs.jsonl mini first stab at a dataset w/ [[positive pair]], collapsed:: true But the only thing I did as a test was that I inspected whether the internal \u0026ldquo;vocab.txt\u0026rdquo; [[vocabulary]] had changed before and after and it did not. However I know better now that this #[[supervised fine-tuning]] does not change the vocabulary since that is fixed in the #tokenizer . So instead, I should have checked, did the weights of the model change and I could have run some #[[cosine similarity]] tests to spot check or also to actually have a #holdout-set , built from my data, to see did the sentences I would have expected get ranked better than before the fine tuning ? 11:12 ok so let me do that one more time and lets check , of all the layers I see in this model, at least the before and after weights of the pooling layer,\nmodel = AutoModel.from_pretrained(\u0026#34;sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2\u0026#34;) print(\u0026#34;how many layers: \u0026#34;, len([x for x in model.modules()])) how many layers: 120 120 layers, oh my, ok lets look at pooler at end,\n[x for x in model.modules()][-5:] # Out[299]: [LayerNorm((384,), eps=1e-12, elementwise_affine=True), Dropout(p=0.1, inplace=False), BertPooler( (dense): Linear(in_features=384, out_features=384, bias=True) (activation): Tanh() ), Linear(in_features=384, out_features=384, bias=True), Tanh()] pooler = [x for x in model.modules()][-3] pooler.dense.weight.shape, pooler.dense.bias.shape # Out[309]: (torch.Size([384, 384]), torch.Size([384])) Ok let me make a deep copy of that, and lets see if that changes w/ my mini mini dataset fine tuning,\nweights_before, bias_before = deepcopy(pooler.dense.weight), deepcopy(pooler.dense.bias) In [312]: weights_before[:, :5] Out[312]: tensor([[-0.0151, -0.0224, -0.0046, -0.0199, 0.0064], [ 0.0083, -0.0186, -0.0132, -0.0009, -0.0157], [-0.0030, 0.0108, -0.0102, 0.0023, -0.0006], ..., [-0.0049, -0.0010, -0.0043, -0.0035, 0.0108], [-0.0089, 0.0108, 0.0011, 0.0227, -0.0051], [ 0.0049, 0.0070, -0.0065, -0.0034, 0.0024]], grad_fn=\u0026lt;SliceBackward0\u0026gt;) In [314]: bias_before[:5] Out[314]: tensor([0., 0., 0., 0., 0.], grad_fn=\u0026lt;SliceBackward0\u0026gt;) ok\nimport os import utils as u from pathlib import Path path = (Path(os.getenv(\u0026#34;REPOS_DIR\u0026#34;)) / \u0026#34;data\u0026#34;

So instead, I need a bigger dataset to try this out. But at least I can see that yes, fine tuning does do something haha.\nCustom dataset thought, might be that instead of sticking to one engineering slice of that jobs dataset, I might try pulling out multiple slices, at least to attempt to see, with a train test split, does the fine tuning help . 12:41 going to look at my personal dataset one more time , One question I have, what percent of the text in my \u0026ldquo;my-challenges-and-accomplishments/experience.yaml\u0026rdquo; am I capturing into my blurb?

Ok then perhaps a slight twist of what I would like to do next, (1) Use the two raw job description dumps from earlier, to build a corpus not of individual sentences, as I had prior, but of job descriptions, attempting to also create a label column that tries to generalize the job titles they have, to hopefully around 5. I can keep \u0026ldquo;amazon\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;google\u0026rdquo; as an additional column for alter too . (2) Create a [[positive pair]] dataset from that , clustering by job title so this time not doing it by hand as much. (3) Split that into a train test . (4) Fine tune train , and then use test , also w/ the [[Multiple negatives ranking loss]] . Maybe I can test before and after the fine tuning. (5) apply to my blurb dataset, and hand inspect what comes up for me.\nok\n","permalink":"https://michal.piekarczyk.xyz/post/2023-06-18-my-projects-langchain-interview-me-2023-feb/","summary":"type:: #project-type status:: #in-progress-status blogDate:: 2023-02-18\nNote This is not a blog post but kind of a landing page I\u0026rsquo;m using to aggregate on-going project notes here\nVision Broadly would like to do here something like the following\ncompare against arbitrary #job-listings , #job-description , collapsed:: true And [[my projects/personal/langchain-interview-me-2023-feb]] , also now the repo usable by anyone who wants to compare their #brag-document to #job-listings [[job-description]] out there , get a delta , and more broadly , understand say , their industry posture , since that’s a moving target .","title":"langchain interview me 2023 feb"},{"content":"Premise Ok, got this half baked idea , combine my #brag-document with the available [[langchain]] QA chains into a proof of concept maybe I can call [[langchain interview me 2023-feb]]\nSo I\u0026rsquo;m going to throw a bunch of my source material together, language based, accessible as plain text doc, and then I will run the Link examples that provide references, citations,\nOk, so for accumulating my information, import yaml import tempfile from pathlib import Path from datetime import datetime import pytz def utc_now(): return datetime.utcnow().replace(tzinfo=pytz.UTC) def utc_ts(dt): return dt.strftime(\u0026#34;%Y-%m-%dT%H%M%S\u0026#34;) def read_yaml(loc): with open(loc) as fd: return yaml.safe_load(fd) from pathlib import Path import os repos_dir = Path(os.getenv(\u0026#34;REPOS_DIR\u0026#34;)) assert repos_dir.is_dir() experience_loc = repos_dir / \u0026#34;my-challenges-and-accomplishments/experience.yaml\u0026#34; experiences_dict = read_yaml(experience_loc)[\u0026#34;Descriptions\u0026#34;] sections = [] for project, detail in experiences_dict.items(): section = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; if detail.get(\u0026#34;company\u0026#34;): company = detail.get(\u0026#34;company\u0026#34;) section = (f\u0026#34;When I worked at {company}, \u0026#34; f\u0026#34;there was a project in {detail[\u0026#39;year\u0026#39;]}, {project}.\u0026#34;) elif detail.get(\u0026#34;project\u0026#34;): project = detail.get(\u0026#34;project\u0026#34;) section = f\u0026#34;In {detail[\u0026#39;year\u0026#39;]}, I had a side project, {project}. \u0026#34; section += \u0026#34;. \u0026#34;.join([x for x in detail.get(\u0026#34;one-liners\u0026#34;, [])]) section += \u0026#34;. \u0026#34;.join([x for x in detail.get(\u0026#34;stories\u0026#34;, [])]) sections.append(section) workdir = repos_dir / \u0026#34;2023-interview-me\u0026#34; path = workdir / f\u0026#34;{utc_ts(utc_now())}-the-story-blurb.txt\u0026#34; path.write_text(\u0026#34;\\n\\n\\n\u0026#34;.join(sections)) Ok let me run now some of the basic question answer chains Use my environment from before,\nsource ~/.python_venvs/langchainz/bin/activate But when trying to use this just like per the qa with sources example in that here,\nfrom langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.embeddings.cohere import CohereEmbeddings from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter from langchain.vectorstores.elastic_vector_search import ElasticVectorSearch from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma from langchain.docstore.document import Document from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate from pathlib import Path workdir = str(repos_dir / \u0026#34;2023-interview-me\u0026#34; ) story_path = repos_dir / \u0026#34;2023-interview-me\u0026#34; / \u0026#34;2023-02-19T011846-the-story-blurb.txt\u0026#34; my_story = story_path.read_text() text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0) texts = text_splitter.split_text(my_story) embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings() docsearch = Chroma.from_texts( texts, embeddings, metadatas=[{\u0026#34;source\u0026#34;: str(i)} for i in range(len(texts))]) from langchain.chains.qa_with_sources import load_qa_with_sources_chain from langchain.llms import OpenAI query = \u0026#34;What kind of projects have I worked on with tensor flow?\u0026#34; docs = docsearch.similarity_search(query) chain = load_qa_with_sources_chain(OpenAI(temperature=0), chain_type=\u0026#34;stuff\u0026#34;) chain({\u0026#34;input_documents\u0026#34;: docs, \u0026#34;question\u0026#34;: query}, return_only_outputs=True) this line,\ndocsearch = Chroma.from_texts(texts, embeddings, metadatas=[{\u0026#34;source\u0026#34;: str(i)} for i in range(len(texts))]) yielded a new install request, so that\u0026rsquo;s what I did,\nValueError: Could not import chromadb python package.

We ended up starting out with this public facing document, which one can seee a description of here with its download link https://content.sunfirematrix.com/2023/Humana-H1036-236-000-SB-EN-2023-SF20220922.pdf .\nMy thought around structured data Hackathons are always very time crunch like environments. I very much wanted us to have at least a minimal end to end demo in our back pocket just in case our additional progress does not pan out.\nSo on the first night, I had this hunch, that the value we can get from our public facing document, would be highest, with additional preprocessing, turning the raw text from this document into full enlish sentences, as opposed to the incomplete English in the document, and also to capture some of the inferred structural connections which are easy to see when visually inspecting, but cannot be captured easily by a raw text dump from the pdf, because perhaps at least the initial pdf to text extraction which we used did not capture this structure.\nOne quick example of this, For instance, here are two tables from the pdf document, that describe the \u0026ldquo;Mail Order Cost-Sharing\u0026rdquo; and the \u0026ldquo;Retail Cost-Sharing\u0026rdquo; options for prescription drug benefits\nAt the outset I handrewrote this as the following clauses\nThis plan has Prescription Drug Benefits . Here is information about what You Pay for Vaccines . Our plan covers most Part D vaccines at no cost to you, no matter what cost-sharing tier it’s on . Here is information about What You Pay for Insulin . You won’t pay more than $35 for a one-month (up to 30-day) supply of each Part D insulin product covered by our plan, no matter what cost-sharing tier it’s on . This applies to all Part D covered insulins, including the Select Insulins covered under the Insulin Savings Program as described below. What you pay for prescription drugs depends on whether you receive \u0026#34;Extra Help\u0026#34; or not. If you receive \u0026#34;Extra Help\u0026#34;, you will still pay no more than $35 for a one-month supply for each Part D covered insulin. Please see your Prescription Drug Guide to find all Part D insulins covered by your plan. This plan does not have a deductible for prescription drugs. If you don\u0026#39;t receive Extra Help for your drugs, you\u0026#39;ll pay a different amount based on the type of cost-sharing option you use. For the Initial coverage, you are responsible to pay for a 30-day supply or a 90-day supply the amount based on the tier of the prescription drug. A prescription drug can be either in tier 1 preferred generic, tier 2 generic, tier 3 preferred brand, tier 4 non-preferred drug, or tier 5 specialty tier. You are responsible to pay for prescription drugs until the total yearly drug costs reach $4,660 . The total yearly drug costs are the total drug costs paid by both you and our plan. Once you reach this amount, you will enter the Coverage Gap. There are two different kinds of cost-sharing for prescription drugs, including Mail Order Cost-Sharing and Retail Cost-Sharing. There are two different kinds of Mail Order pharmacy options, Standard and Preferred. The Mail order pharmacy option called Standard includes Walmart Mail, PillPack and other pharmacies that are also available in our network. To find pharmacy mail order options go to Humana.com/pharmacyfinder . The second type of mail order pharmacy option is the Preferred pharmacy option, which includes only the CenterWell Pharmacy. For the Standard Mail order pharmacy option, for Tier 1 Preferred Generic drugs, the 30-day supply costs $10 and the 90-day supply costs $30. For the Standard Mail order pharmacy option, for Tier 2 Generic drugs, the 30-day supply costs $20 and the 90-day supply costs $60. For the Standard Mail order pharmacy option, for Tier 3 Preferred Brand drugs, the 30-day supply costs $47 and the 90-day supply costs $141. For the Standard Mail order pharmacy option, for Tier 4 Non-Preferred drugs, the 30-day supply costs $100 and the 90-day supply costs $300. For the Standard Mail order pharmacy option, for Tier 5 Specialty Tier drugs, the 30-day supply costs 33% and the 90-day supply is not available. For the Preferred CenterWell Pharmacy Mail order pharmacy option, for Tier 1 Preferred Generic drugs, the 30-day supply costs $0 and the 90-day supply costs $0. For the Preferred CenterWell Pharmacy Mail order pharmacy option, for Tier 2 Generic drugs, the 30-day supply costs $0 and the 90-day supply costs $0. For the Preferred CenterWell Pharmacy Mail order pharmacy option, for Tier 3 Preferred Brand drugs, the 30-day supply costs $42 and the 90-day supply costs $116. For the Preferred CenterWell Pharmacy Mail order pharmacy option, for Tier 4 Non-Preferred drugs, the 30-day supply costs $100 and the 90-day supply costs $290. For the Preferred CenterWell Pharmacy Mail order pharmacy option, for Tier 5 Specialty Tier drugs, the 30-day supply costs 33% and the 90-day supply is not available. The other kind of prescription drug cost sharing is called Retail Cost-Sharing, which means that you can physically go to the pharmacy. You can go to any network retail pharmacy. To find the retail pharmacies near you, go to Humana.com/pharmacyfinder For the retail pharmacy option, for Tier 1 Preferred Generic drugs, the 30-day supply costs $0 and the 90-day supply costs $0. For the retail pharmacy option, for Tier 2 Generic drugs, the 30-day supply costs $0 and the 90-day supply costs $0. For the retail pharmacy option, for Tier 3 Preferred Brand drugs, the 30-day supply costs $42 and the 90-day supply costs $116. For the retail pharmacy option, for Tier 4 Non-Preferred drugs, the 30-day supply costs $100 and the 90-day supply costs $300. For the retail pharmacy option, for Tier 5 Specialty Tier drugs, the 30-day supply costs 33% and the 90-day supply is not available. Maybe there are really good libraries for inferring the generically inferring the tabular structure , but at least for the time being I really wanted to constrain the problem a bit more since my brain was in hackathon mode haha 😅\nA fully end to end version 1 demo So the day before I had already proven to myself, that the #langchain LLMChain class is really good at having a targeted conversation framed around some kind of small talk, with the use of a prompt that provides the focus. Also , earlier, I had shown myself just how quickly haha, no, instantaneously, you can use #langchain to embed a targeted bit of text, a section of a magazine article in my case, and run question answering based on this.\nI have not tried it yet but langchain also has the concept of an agent, which can compartmentalize separate functionality, say for engaging in small talk and separately for answering questions on an insurance plan document.\nAlready having some components already working in front of me, I wanted to at least first build a super simple demo, more or less jamming together the small talk prompts I had explored earlier with the document focused question answering.\nI ended up with something like this from langchain import OpenAI, ConversationChain, LLMChain, PromptTemplate from langchain.chains.conversation.memory import ConversationalBufferWindowMemory from langchain import PromptTemplate name_of_person = \u0026#34;Alfred Jamesmanson\u0026#34; real_person_prompt = f\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; Assistant is uses friendly and helpful language.

Super weird. Maybe I should not have activation functions on the inner layers? Nah I don\u0026apos;t think that\u0026apos;s the problem.

So at this point one thought I have for sure is whether this network is just one layer more complicated than would be needed for a problem set this simple. The thought arose after seeing that weight output from last training, But in any case, I think for now I am curious if I can find more bugs. So, we are underfitting here. So the loss is just increasing steadily and I see the layer 1 and layer 2 weights are just increasing steadily as well. So makes me think this is related. 16:02 let me try to observe the updates , import network as n import dataset import plot import runner import ipdb import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import pylab from collections import Counter from utils import utc_now, utc_ts data = dataset.build_dataset_inside_outside_circle(0.5) parameters = {\u0026quot;learning_rate\u0026quot;: 0.01, \u0026quot;steps\u0026quot;: 50, \u0026quot;log_loss_every_k_steps\u0026quot;: 10 } runner.train_and_analysis(data, parameters) 17:26 ah well spotted one silly bug in tracking the metrics, so I had the train and validation loss I was logging flipped, if step % log_loss_every_k_steps == 0: _, total_loss = loss(model, data.X_validation, data.Y_validation) metrics[\u0026quot;train\u0026quot;][\u0026quot;loss_vec\u0026quot;].append(total_loss) _, total_loss = loss(model, data.X_train, data.Y_train) metrics[\u0026quot;validation\u0026quot;][\u0026quot;loss_vec\u0026quot;].append(total_loss) fixed now so it is if step % log_loss_every_k_steps == 0: _, total_loss = loss(model, data.X_validation, data.Y_validation) metrics[\u0026quot;validation\u0026quot;][\u0026quot;loss_vec\u0026quot;].append(total_loss) _, total_loss = loss(model, data.X_train, data.Y_train) metrics[\u0026quot;train\u0026quot;][\u0026quot;loss_vec\u0026quot;].append(total_loss) A bug indeed, but would not affect the training itself . Ok I think good thing to do next, continue my low level debugging such that as I calculate g , if gradient descent is working properly, then I should be able to write an assert that I think the loss at least for the single example should decrease after applying g update, otherwise something is wrong ! 19:27 ok to check this I then have to calculate the loss on the micro-batch I\u0026apos;m using here, ok, first here is how I would reshape a single example to obtain its loss, i = 0 x, y = data.X_train[i], data.Y_train[i] x.shape, y.shape Y_actual, total_loss = n.loss(model, x.reshape((1, -1)), y.reshape((1, 1))) print(\u0026quot;(x, y)\u0026quot;, (x, y)) print(\u0026quot;Y_actual\u0026quot;, Y_actual) print(\u0026quot;loss\u0026quot;, total_loss) (x, y) (array([ -7.55637702, -12.67353685]), 1) Y_actual [0.93243955] loss 0.06995095896007311 And side not I realized technically I\u0026apos;m not plotting the training loss, since the training set has 9,000 rows and I\u0026apos;m only really using 500 or so of them so far. So I will adjust the training loss calculation for specifically that portion I use. 20:27 ok cool, going to try out this new code where I also now am logging the before and after for each microbatch loss import network as n import dataset import plot import runner import ipdb import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import pylab from collections import Counter from utils import utc_now, utc_ts data = dataset.build_dataset_inside_outside_circle(0.5) parameters = {\u0026quot;learning_rate\u0026quot;: 0.01, \u0026quot;steps\u0026quot;: 500, \u0026quot;log_loss_every_k_steps\u0026quot;: 10 } model, artifacts, metrics = runner.train_and_analysis(data, parameters) outer: 100%|█████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████| 500/500 [00:12\u0026lt;00:00, 40.35it/s] saving to 2022-10-03T003158.png 2022-10-03T003158.png 2022-10-03T003159-weights.png 2022-10-03T003200-hist.png saving to 2022-10-03T003201-scatter.png 2022-10-03T003201-scatter.png And let me look at those micro batch updates then In [8]: metrics[\u0026quot;micro_batch_updates\u0026quot;][:5] Out[8]: [{\u0026apos;loss_before\u0026apos;: 0.43903926069642474, \u0026apos;y_actual_before\u0026apos;: array([0.64465547]), \u0026apos;x\u0026apos;: array([-9.44442228, 1.4129736 ]), \u0026apos;y\u0026apos;: 1, \u0026apos;loss_after\u0026apos;: 0.43757904199626413, \u0026apos;y_actual_after\u0026apos;: array([0.6455975])}, {\u0026apos;loss_before\u0026apos;: 1.0263273283159982, \u0026apos;y_actual_before\u0026apos;: array([0.64167946]), \u0026apos;x\u0026apos;: array([-3.4136343 , 17.13301918]), \u0026apos;y\u0026apos;: 0, \u0026apos;loss_after\u0026apos;: 1.0309406841349795, \u0026apos;y_actual_after\u0026apos;: array([0.64332871])}, {\u0026apos;loss_before\u0026apos;: 0.4300753021013386, \u0026apos;y_actual_before\u0026apos;: array([0.65046011]), \u0026apos;x\u0026apos;: array([-2.26675345, -5.20582749]), \u0026apos;y\u0026apos;: 1, \u0026apos;loss_after\u0026apos;: 0.4285424015973017, \u0026apos;y_actual_after\u0026apos;: array([0.65145797])}, {\u0026apos;loss_before\u0026apos;: 1.0544704530873739, \u0026apos;y_actual_before\u0026apos;: array([0.65162314]), \u0026apos;x\u0026apos;: array([ 14.74873303, -16.34664216]), \u0026apos;y\u0026apos;: 0, \u0026apos;loss_after\u0026apos;: 1.0598453040833464, \u0026apos;y_actual_after\u0026apos;: array([0.65349059])}, {\u0026apos;loss_before\u0026apos;: 0.42370781274874675, \u0026apos;y_actual_before\u0026apos;: array([0.65461512]), \u0026apos;x\u0026apos;: array([ 1.71615885, -11.0142264 ]), \u0026apos;y\u0026apos;: 1, \u0026apos;loss_after\u0026apos;: 0.42217509911520096, \u0026apos;y_actual_after\u0026apos;: array([0.65561923])}] import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from utils import utc_now, utc_ts import pylab deltas = [x[\u0026quot;loss_after\u0026quot;] - x[\u0026quot;loss_before\u0026quot;] for x in metrics[\u0026quot;micro_batch_updates\u0026quot;]] with plt.style.context(\u0026quot;fivethirtyeight\u0026quot;): plt.hist(deltas, bins=50) out_loc = f\u0026quot;{utc_ts(utc_now())}-micro-batch-loss-deltas.png\u0026quot; print(\u0026quot;saving to\u0026quot;, out_loc) pylab.savefig(out_loc, bbox_inches=\u0026quot;tight\u0026quot;) pylab.close() plt.close() # saving to 2022-10-03T005623-micro-batch-loss-deltas.png Wow fascinating, so a lot of the loss is getting reduced, at least slightly more than not haha, In [17]: from collections import Counter ...: Counter([\u0026quot;loss_reduction\u0026quot; if x \u0026lt; 0 else \u0026quot;loss_increase\u0026quot; for x in [y for y in deltas if y != 0]]) Out[17]: Counter({\u0026apos;loss_reduction\u0026apos;: 260, \u0026apos;loss_increase\u0026apos;: 240}) And with plt.style.context(\u0026quot;fivethirtyeight\u0026quot;): plt.plot(deltas) out_loc = f\u0026quot;{utc_ts(utc_now())}-micro-batch-loss-deltas-over-steps.png\u0026quot; print(\u0026quot;saving to\u0026quot;, out_loc) pylab.savefig(out_loc, bbox_inches=\u0026quot;tight\u0026quot;) pylab.close() plt.close() But wow, this next plot is fascinating! with plt.style.context(\u0026quot;fivethirtyeight\u0026quot;): fig = plt.figure(figsize =(20, 9)) plt.plot(deltas, linewidth=0.7) plt.title(\u0026quot;Microbatch loss_after - loss_before\u0026quot;) out_loc = f\u0026quot;{utc_ts(utc_now())}-micro-batch-loss-deltas-over-steps.png\u0026quot; print(\u0026quot;saving to\u0026quot;, out_loc) pylab.savefig(out_loc, bbox_inches=\u0026quot;tight\u0026quot;) pylab.close() plt.close() So according to the above, yes the microbatch delta loss is ping ponging back and forth and basically getting worse, for the different microbatch inputs .

I had literally just initialized a new network and got this first example, ipdb\u0026gt; p x, y (array([10.31816265, -8.80044688]), 1) while running the ipdb debug mode, and inside of train_network() , ran --\u0026gt; 186 y_prob = feed_forward(x, model.layers, verbose=False) and got ipdb\u0026gt; p y_prob 0.5 Let me just use joblib to save this so I can just test it again.

Maybe this is purely a coincidence?!????! So at this moment for this particular network, the input has no effect basically , In [12]: [n.feed_forward(x, model.layers, verbose=False) ...: for x in [ ...: [10.31816265, -8.80044688], ...: [1, 1], ...: [0, 0], ...: [1e4, -1e4] ...: ]] Out[12]: [0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5] ok so currently, the final sum appears to always be negative and so the relu(negative_num) step at the end always produces a 0 and then after that I have a sigmoid so for 0 yea makes sense the output is the 0.5 . but why is the input into that final relu always seeming to be negative then ? 15:05 so I think I want to answer a side question , of hey if I create a bunch of random networks, will they all have this weirdness? If not then this might not be a problem . ok so , from tqdm import tqdm import numpy as np import network as n import dataset import plot import runner import ipdb import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import pylab from collections import Counter from utils import utc_now, utc_ts data = dataset.build_dataset_inside_outside_circle(0.5) parameters = {\u0026quot;learning_rate\u0026quot;: 0.01, \u0026quot;steps\u0026quot;: 100, \u0026quot;log_loss_every_k_steps\u0026quot;: 10 } outputs = [] x = np.array([10.31816265, -8.80044688]) for _ in tqdm(range(10000)): model = n.initialize_model(parameters) outputs.append(n.feed_forward(x, model.layers, verbose=False)) plt.hist(outputs, bins=50) out_loc = f\u0026quot;{utc_ts(utc_now())}.png\u0026quot; print(\u0026quot;saving to\u0026quot;, out_loc) pylab.savefig(out_loc, bbox_inches=\u0026quot;tight\u0026quot;) pylab.close() # saving to 2022-09-25T192657.png 15:28 ok so false alarm from the sense that, the network is not always stuck at 0.5 . And the 0.5 is special only because this is the minimum possible when the step before the sigmoid happens to be a relu . stories heh. But maybe does beg the question, hey my dataset output is either 0 or 1 so if my minimum is 0.5 , well that\u0026apos;s not ideal haha! So I need to for sure next either scale the output so the [0.5, 1.0] maps to [0, 1.0] or otherwise, just get rid of that relu all together since I can then allow for all values , mapping into that sigmoid , and that would produce the [0, 1.0] I need . 17:38 ok so if I take out the final relu, I will also have to adjust the partial derivative calculations too, 18:19 ok so first I just updated the feed_forward , so then now on commit , 61465a5 , redoing the above mini test, we have , for _ in tqdm(range(10000)): model = n.initialize_model(parameters) outputs.append(n.feed_forward(x, model.layers, verbose=False)) plt.hist(outputs, bins=50) out_loc = f\u0026quot;{utc_ts(utc_now())}.png\u0026quot; print(\u0026quot;saving to\u0026quot;, out_loc) pylab.savefig(out_loc, bbox_inches=\u0026quot;tight\u0026quot;) pylab.close() # saving to 2022-09-25T222204.png 18:41 hmm ok so this is still kind of asymmetric but finally getting the values less than 0.5 so better than before.

Anyway, 13:35 finally looking, so the weird issue was my log loss was getting worse with training when only affecting the final layer , so then I plotted the raw input data with a 3d surface plot but it was really weird looking and shapeless . I plotted this on a 2d plot instead and yea looked reasonable. But yea the 95% label=0 to to 5% label=1 maybe was contributing to why the 3d surface plot looked formless and uninteresting. And for fun I tweaked my 2d plotting code to use a spectrum of colors so I can perhaps look at my output data. But then oh wow oops I realized all the predictions were basically just 0.5 . So my main thought then was that haha probably training just the last layer of a network is basically not useful. 13:44 ok so let me continue with a strategy to train the full network and not just the final layer , look back at my network, 13:48 quick capture: Just going to write up the partial derivative parts of the gradient one at a time, 16:53 ok I have added this to the code now . let me try that train loop again then import network as n import plot X, Y = n.build_dataset_inside_outside_circle() layers = n.initialize_network_layers() loss_vec, layers = n.train_network(X, Y, layers) plot.plot_loss_vec(loss_vec) 17:12 ok output above is pretty interesting. Probably if indeed things are working, the learning rate is too high. But haha in case something is actually working, let me actually try plotting the predictions for the loss after the first round which I think looks lowest. layers = n.initialize_network_layers() loss_vec, layers, artifacts = n.train_network(X, Y, layers, log_loss_each_round=True, steps=10) layers = artifacts[\u0026quot;9\u0026quot;][\u0026quot;model\u0026quot;] Y_actual, total_loss = n.loss(layers, X, Y) layers = artifacts[\u0026quot;9\u0026quot;][\u0026quot;model\u0026quot;] Y_actual, total_loss = n.loss(layers, X, Y) plot.scatter_plot_by_z(X, Y_actual) 17:39 ok haha that\u0026apos;s kind of confusing. Not sure why the second time around, pretty sure I did not re-generate the data, the loss on this training round went down and stayed down. Likely the first time around we must have jumped too far from the minimum irrecoverably. And the second time, since indeed the weights are generated randomly, we stayed close. But also for the second round, when plotting some outputs, clearly we see something funky is going on. And also I suspect that since I have not fixed that whole 95% to 5% dataset imbalance, some funkiness is happening and indeed the loss does appear to be small because the penalty on the imbalanced dataset is not shining through. 17:47 So the imbalanced dataset is likely messing with learning and also with the perception of the loss as well. 20:30 ok to balance out that data, probably simplest is to generate data where the circle is just bigger 20:52 ok so I ended up with something like, # dataset.py import math import numpy as np from collections import Counter def build_dataset_inside_outside_circle(balance=0.5): # Create some data in a 20x20 box centered at origin. num_samples = 10000 radius = math.sqrt(40*40*balance/math.pi) X = np.random.random((num_samples, 2)) * 40 + -20 f = (lambda a: int(np.sqrt(a[0]**2 + a[1]**2) \u0026lt;= radius)) Y = np.array(list(map(f, X))) # Validate balance assert abs(Counter(Y)[1]/num_samples - balance) \u0026lt; 0.02 return X, Y import dataset import plot X, Y = dataset.build_dataset_inside_outside_circle(0.5) plot.scatter_plot_by_z(X, Y) # saving to 2022-08-28T005137-scatter.png 20:58 ok lets see what happens with training then , layers = n.initialize_network_layers() loss_vec, layers, artifacts = n.train_network(X, Y, layers, log_loss_every_k_steps=10, steps=1000) outer: 100%|███████████████████████████████████████████████| 1000/1000 [04:45\u0026lt;00:00, 3.51it/s] plot.plot_loss_vec(loss_vec) # saving to 2022-08-28T012206.png 21:20 ok so this time definitely a little more time to train since I\u0026apos;ve been measuring log loss every 10 steps on all 10,000 samples but I can do fewer next time to iterate more quickly.

And if given some time series data, is it possible to predict the next day. Or at least something about the next day. I suspect the data is somewhat cyclical at least with respect to patterns of \u0026ldquo;restraint\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;indulgence\u0026rdquo; , but also maybe with respect to week and weekend. Initially I think I want to use frequency based features, but perhaps afterwards I can compare that with an LSTM approach. I also have some calorie data, but it is only for about 3 months or so, and maybe I can use that somehow too later. Perhaps I can even later on try using exercise data, sleep data if available. And there is of course temperature and weather data. Next steps Write out some interesting questions I would like to answer. What is my feature list so far , as a sort of data dictionary. Can do some initial data exploration, with visualizations. Build a dataset based on some initial features, Interesting Questions ? Given a sequence of days, is there an interesting target variable, such as the hours fasted, which can be predicted of the next day or even the next few days or next week? A core qualitative question is, whether a period of restraint (more fasting) is followed by a period of less restraint (less fasting)? And maybe an extension of the above is whether fasting appears to be cyclical and how would you even measure this? How does the number of prior days of activity improve the accuracy of the prediction of the next day? Feature list initial most recent fast started before midnight most recent fast ended before 20:00 most recent fast more than 18 hours most recent fast more than 16 hours most recent fast more than 14 hours last two fasts, average start time before midnight last two fasts, average end time before 20:00 last two fasts, average more than 18 hours last two fasts, average more than 16 hours last two fasts, max is more than 18 hours last two fasts, min is more than 18 hours last two fasts, m in is more than 16 hours Next Yea next I would like to start building out a dataset of these features And would be cool to visualize some of these features too, get some summary stats on them. 2021-06-28 build dataset\u0026hellip; import os import pandas as pd workdir = os.getenv(\u0026#34;WORKDIR\u0026#34;) datadir = os.getenv(\u0026#34;DATADIR\u0026#34;) loc = f\u0026#34;{datadir}/2021-06-26-zero-fast.csv\u0026#34; df = pd.read_csv(loc) In [3]: df.shape Out[3]: (1109, 5) In [4]: df.iloc[:4] Out[4]: Date Start End Hours Night Eating 0 6/26/21 01:57 NaN NaN NaN 1 6/25/21 00:14 17:17 17.0 NaN 2 6/24/21 01:50 18:39 16.0 NaN 3 6/23/21 01:02 19:21 18.0 NaN Probably the simples question, is what is a unit of fasting? A fast can start and end on two different dates or it can start and end on the same day. A Fast can also span multiple days and it can also happen while traveling, resulting in different time zones messing with the data. However this dataset doesn\u0026rsquo;t appear to have time zones, so I wonder if it kind of simplifies that. Simplest I think is to ignore the first row for example, Date Start End Hours Night Eating 0 6/26/21 01:57 NaN NaN NaN Since this fast is on-going. So a fast unit has a start and an end. In [6]: df[df.Hours.isnull()].shape, df.shape Out[6]: ((1, 5), (1109, 5)) Ok per above only the latest fast would be null then. Next Start writing that dataset write a fast id perhaps as the \u0026ldquo;start-date-start-time\u0026rdquo; which would be unique, and has to have defined end of course. And figure out what does that \u0026ldquo;Night Eating\u0026rdquo; column mean. names for the features I started writing out. 2021-06-30 quick notes Also realized that the time between fasts can be a feature too.\nFor each \u0026ldquo;row\u0026rdquo;, we can basically say the \u0026ldquo;End time\u0026rdquo; is a separator between what happened before a fasting event, which can be used to create the \u0026ldquo;X\u0026rdquo; or independent variables and what happens after is the \u0026ldquo;Y\u0026rdquo; or dependent variables.\nSo for each row, if using pandas for example, we want a way to take perhaps 4 or more rows surrounding it and that would be used to create the features.\nPerhaps this feels like a job for rolling window , interesting article\n# most recent fast started before midnight updated feature list Feature list initial most recent fast started before midnight most recent fast ended before 20:00 most recent fast more than 18 hours most recent fast more than 16 hours most recent fast more than 14 hours last two fasts, average start time before midnight last two fasts, both start time before midnight last two fasts, average end time before 20:00 last two fasts, average more than 18 hours last two fasts, average more than 16 hours last two fasts, max is more than 18 hours last two fasts, min is more than 18 hours last two fasts, m in is more than 16 hours last two feeding windows, average less than 4 hours 2021-07-07 tried this rolling calc Looks good just need to calibrate the direction. df[\u0026#39;RollingHoursMean2Fasts\u0026#39;] = df[\u0026#39;Hours\u0026#39;].rolling(2).mean() In [8]: df.iloc[:10] Out[8]: Date Start End Hours Night Eating RollingHoursMean2Fasts 0 6/26/21 01:57 NaN NaN NaN NaN 1 6/25/21 00:14 17:17 17.0 NaN NaN 2 6/24/21 01:50 18:39 16.0 NaN 16.5 3 6/23/21 01:02 19:21 18.0 NaN 17.0 4 6/22/21 00:06 17:52 17.0 NaN 17.5 5 6/21/21 01:46 20:55 19.0 NaN 18.0 6 6/20/21 04:39 13:28 8.0 NaN 13.5 7 6/19/21 02:37 18:21 15.0 NaN 11.5 8 6/18/21 01:41 18:41 17.0 NaN 16.0 9 6/17/21 01:02 21:38 20.0 NaN 18.5 2021-07-09 Add index too\u0026hellip; import datetime df[\u0026#39;StartDt\u0026#39;] = df.apply(lambda x: datetime.datetime(int(f\u0026#34;20{x.Date.split(\u0026#39;/\u0026#39;)[2]}\u0026#34;), int(x.Date.split(\u0026#34;/\u0026#34;)[0]), int(x.Date.split(\u0026#34;/\u0026#34;)[1]), int(x.Start.split(\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;)[0]), int(x.Start.split(\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;)[1]) ), axis=1) df[\u0026#39;id\u0026#39;] = df.apply(lambda x: x.StartDt.strftime(\u0026#34;%Y-%m-%dT%H%M\u0026#34;), axis=1) In [21]: df.iloc[:10] Out[21]: Date Start End Hours Night Eating RollingHoursMean2Fasts StartDt id 0 6/26/21 01:57 NaN NaN NaN NaN 2021-06-26 01:57:00 2021-06-26T0157 1 6/25/21 00:14 17:17 17.0 NaN NaN 2021-06-25 00:14:00 2021-06-25T0014 2 6/24/21 01:50 18:39 16.0 NaN 16.5 2021-06-24 01:50:00 2021-06-24T0150 3 6/23/21 01:02 19:21 18.0 NaN 17.0 2021-06-23 01:02:00 2021-06-23T0102 4 6/22/21 00:06 17:52 17.0 NaN 17.5 2021-06-22 00:06:00 2021-06-22T0006 5 6/21/21 01:46 20:55 19.0 NaN 18.0 2021-06-21 01:46:00 2021-06-21T0146 6 6/20/21 04:39 13:28 8.0 NaN 13.5 2021-06-20 04:39:00 2021-06-20T0439 7 6/19/21 02:37 18:21 15.0 NaN 11.5 2021-06-19 02:37:00 2021-06-19T0237 8 6/18/21 01:41 18:41 17.0 NaN 16.0 2021-06-18 01:41:00 2021-06-18T0141 9 6/17/21 01:02 21:38 20.0 NaN 18.5 2021-06-17 01:02:00 2021-06-17T0102 Looking at above, I see that RollingHoursMean2Fasts for 2021-06-24T0150 is 16.5 = mean([17, 16]) , so the rows it is taking into account should be current row and next not current row and last Next Make RollingHoursMean2Fasts be for current and previous fast , not current and future fast haha since cannot know the future! 2021-07-10 how to update the rolling window to reflect the last 2 fasts df[\u0026#39;foo\u0026#39;] = df[\u0026#39;Hours\u0026#39;].shift(-1) df[\u0026#39;RollingHoursMean2Fasts\u0026#39;] = df[\u0026#39;Hours\u0026#39;].shift(-1).rolling(2).mean() Nice, per the below, this is perfect.

Instead of great search I would take notes on paper or white board and then at least be able to have a descriptive title and be able to look up my notes on demand. Having notes at all and being able to find them was a big step beyond having scattered notes I could never find. But there would be no mind space for me to connect ideas and thoughts. I feel like conversations and #journaling are great ways to spit ball ideas but then you occasionally write them down somewhere and it feels good to get them out of your brain but then what. I enjoy writing occasionally of course but I agree with this book author\u0026rsquo;s ([[Sonke Ahrens]] ) premise that you end up starting from scratch and blank slate writing (which feels like [[top down]] writing ) is hard. And [[bottom up]] writing which is this method, is pretty intriguing! This idea I came across a while back at a google talk about [[start public/open source as opposed to private and then try to make it public]] with respect to code but I have been going down that path for my notes as well. Culminating with the [[book ShowYourWork]] I suppose you should be tactful with what you make public so I am still trying to find the balance. Questions\nWhenever I dive into a \u0026ldquo;Roam\u0026rdquo; session\u0026ndash;elaborating on my notes, making connections and splitting/joining topics\u0026ndash;I feel like it takes a lot of time indeed. I guess the [[slip box]] needs a [[TimeBoxing]] haha? But how long should it take? Concepts\nStep by Step , from the author\u0026rsquo;s Introduction, on [[How to write an article using ZettleKasten]] Make fleeting notes Make literature notes Make permanent notes One idea per note. But in a digital sense this feels like it extends. Add your new permanent notes into the slip-box Build topics that slowly grow into mature material for your writing. The permanent notes are like seeds, but I think you can also have \u0026ldquo;connective tissue notes\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;meta notes\u0026rdquo; where I imagine you elaborate on and strengthen some of the links. Maybe they also end up having one idea? Copy some of these linked ideas to your \u0026ldquo;Desktop\u0026rdquo; . Sort them, start to edit them, find missing links, Make a first rough draft. Edit / proofread (And I imagine here is the writing/editing cycle). Polish. Don\u0026rsquo;t plan instead be an expert [[Dont plan be an expert]] Wow this speaks to me. plans are rigid indeed. the other way to think about it is I can’t explain why but whenever I make a todo list, especially if it is long, I kind of don’t feel like doing it. I like the concept of calling it the “Maybe list” though. or the “defect list”/“bug list” for issues to resolve . the alternative is the vision. and when you express the vision, short term, within your context, frame of thought, everything else just kind of falls into place “ Having a clear structure to work in is completely different from making plans about something. If you make a plan, you impose a structure on yourself; it makes you inflexible. To keep going according to plan, you have to push yourself and employ willpower. This is not only demotivating, but also unsuitable for an open-ended process like research, thinking or studying in general, where we have to adjust our next steps with every new insight, understanding or achievement – which we ideally have on a regular basis and not just as an exception”. Write whenever you feel like it and make new connections ((cda0b87a-cc5f-4794-903e-3e0187920254)) But as a technical note, Dumping/processing your notes immediately feels crucial because it almost becomes a kind of \u0026ldquo;now or never or much much later\u0026rdquo; kind of game. So that begs the question is it even worth writing on paper or a whiteboard without then immediately distilling the \u0026ldquo;fleeting notes\u0026rdquo; . If you don\u0026rsquo;t it is difficult to later sift through them. [[distilling the gist vs collecting/archiving ]] Read for understanding ((8b7a2887-b77f-4c13-97b7-b7ed22900ea9)) ((26378e7a-5d76-418b-aeb9-32533c84c921)) ((ac860cbd-7b9d-4477-abc9-d26e8294ffc2)) Elaboration The putting into your own words and connecting concept reminds me of an interesting [[person Tim Ferris]] video where he talks about circling phrases in your #journal but also deleting what you don\u0026rsquo;t need. I like keeping at least references to primary sources but as for my own notes, I like the concept of letting ideas in your notes percolate to the top. So perhaps you discard but even if you don\u0026rsquo;t, there\u0026rsquo;s no need to look at the deeper material. \u0026ldquo;The first step of elaboration is to think enough about a piece of information so we are able to write about it. The second step is to think about what it means for other contexts as well.\u0026rdquo; (p104)\n,\u0026ldquo;Connections can be made between heterogeneous notes – as long as the connection makes sense. This is the best antidote to the impeding way most information is given to us in our learning institutions. Most often, it comes in modular form, sorted by topic, separated by disciplines and generally isolated from other information. The slip-box is forcing us to do the exact opposite: To elaborate, to understand, to connect and therefore to learn seriously.\u0026rdquo; (p106)\nLearn from mistakes Most people dont larn from their mistakes! \u0026ldquo;Alas, rarely does a product developer show any interest in learning from the experience of others. Often, companies don’t even keep track of their own failed attempts, providing McMath with whole series in which one kind of mistake was made in multiple variations, sometimes from each generation of developers in the same company (McMath and Forbes 1999).\u0026rdquo; (Page 127)\nHow to write/attach good Topics to notes\nArchivist vs writer!!! Favor retrieval . This is like tattoo selection in the [[movie memento]] then. And the post it notes. Limited writing surface. Careful selection. Ok so write keywords or entry links with the expectation of how to stumble upon that best in the future \u0026ldquo;The way people choose their keywords shows clearly if they think like an archivist or a writer. Do they wonder where to store a note or how to retrieve it? The archivist asks: Which keyword is the most fitting? A writer asks: In which circumstances will I want to stumble upon this note, even if I forget about it? It is a crucial difference.\u0026rdquo; ( page 110 )\nI really like that this gives you permission to be \u0026ldquo;selective\u0026rdquo; because you accept that you don\u0026rsquo;t need everything and I definitely come from the \u0026ldquo;archivist\u0026rdquo; mindset. No need to convert everything My Questions\nShould you have more links? or fewer links? Slightly not sure because selectivity is suggested, \u0026ldquo;The organisation of the notes is in the network of references in the slip-box, so all we need from the index are entry points. A few wisely chosen notes are sufficient for each entry point. The quicker we get from the index to the concrete notes, the quicker we move our attention from mentally preconceived ideas towards the fact-rich level of interconnected content, where we can conduct a fact-based dialogue with the slip-box.\u0026rdquo; (p 109 )\nShould you update your notes as you construct your manuscript? because author talks about filling in manuscript gaps , \u0026hellip; \u0026ldquo;gaps in the arguments in the final manuscript – but these gaps will only become obvious in the next step, when we take the relevant notes for an argument out of the network of the slip-box and sort them into the linear order for the rough draft.\u0026rdquo; ( p 108)\nStill want to know for these #evergreen-note or #[[permanent note]] , how large should they be? Raw Notes\n“ What does make a significant difference along the whole intelligence spectrum is something else: how much self- discipline or self-control one uses to approach the tasks at hand (Duckworth and Seligman, 2005; Tangney, Baumeister, and Boone, 2004).” References\nAuthor recommends this program, http://zettelkasten.danielluedecke.de/en/index.php for [[ZettleKasten method]] Write whenever you feel like it and make new connections\n\u0026ldquo;Author basically says yea some people rely on #brainstorming to come up with new ideas or #group-brainstorming but he argues okay the [[slip box]] [[ZettleKasten method]] is better because you\u0026rsquo;re brainstorming every day so might as well just capture your ideas every day .

Author says if you are not doing for someone other than yourself, then that is also #amateur status. Also , of what you do, it will not be for everyone Work with empathy, not reassurance. Just be generous, ship that work, on a schedule. And take feedback. My questions You are serving your audience, What if you don\u0026rsquo;t have an audience yet. I understand that doing something \u0026ldquo;for someone \u0026quot; maybe is all you need? What if it\u0026rsquo;s a surprise to them, are you still \u0026ldquo;on the hook\u0026rdquo; then?

Are you still in amateur territory if You\u0026rsquo;re still searching for someone (other than yourself) who would use what you\u0026rsquo;re creating? Or is it enough to just \u0026ldquo;be generous\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;commit to your practice\u0026rdquo; as you continue the search for someone who is interested in your work? \u0026quot; Source: show up even if you don\u0026rsquo;t feel like it. I understand it still counts if you don\u0026rsquo;t get paid. Do you need a company? [[how creative should you be at work?]] So i still want to know does Seth say we should give ourselves permission to be creative both at work and in our personal endeavours. #Creativity to me means going outside your [[ComfortZone]] all the time. But I feel this can be perceived as a waste of time to put it one way since it takes longer than the \u0026ldquo;bare minimum\u0026rdquo;. This is also called the \u0026ldquo;Minimum Viable Product\u0026rdquo; and typically feels like you are \u0026ldquo;hacking something together\u0026rdquo; as opposed to say creating something you are proud of. Ok so you want to chance on higher quality work, work that helps you grow faster, that is more worth your time, more creative. So how? Feels like the answer is to be an opportunity hunter of sorts. And yea probably must stop what you are doing from time to time to address something new ,\u0026ldquo;Location 417\u0026rdquo;,\u0026ldquo;If you want to change your story, change your actions first. When we choose to act a certain way, our mind can’t help but rework our narrative to make those actions become coherent.\u0026rdquo; Ok this is like fake it til you make it i guess. I mean what are the actions available. Just got to keep trying to do do do no matter what others say i suppose. Ok so shipping work , what counts as shipping. Publicly on your github for world to judge. Does that count? Like your portfolio which you\u0026rsquo;re using to try find new clients. You\u0026rsquo;re on the hook in my mind for whether your work is chosen I suppose you some people have various commitment devices like to their friends even. Or other people have \u0026ldquo;Sunday Newsletters\u0026rdquo; I know [[person Ali Abdaal]] does this. Quotes \u0026ldquo;The time we spend worrying is actually time we’re spending trying to control something that is out of our control.

Time invested in something that is within our control is called work. That’s where our most productive focus lies.\u0026rdquo; (Location 1173) Very much reminds me of the quote in [[book How to Take Smart Notes]] , [[Don\u0026rsquo;t plan be an expert]] which of course is linked to [[book Blink]] and other [[Freakenomics]] concepts like [[Do experts choke?]] and of course [[book Range]] was also about knowing what to do in an emergency and not just trying to recall some rules you learned There\u0026rsquo;s a distinction between jobs that dictate exactly what you should do and those where you shape the result actively. You play an active role. The author I think calls the latter an artist ,\u0026ldquo;Location 289\u0026rdquo;,\u0026ldquo;It’s often called “art.”\u0026rdquo; This is funny because indeed jobs don\u0026rsquo;t want artists. They want you to fit their round holes. An artist is a square peg indeed. [[thought-leader]] I remember this distinction from the [[game DreamFall]] and [[game TheLongestJourney]] they called that being a [[DreamFall/wave]]. Because well you\u0026rsquo;re either making one or riding one. ,\u0026ldquo;Location 324\u0026rdquo;,\u0026ldquo;In every field of endeavour, some people stand out as the makers of what’s next, as the voices of what’s now.\u0026rdquo; Kind of inspiring actually to think in these terms, to be that kind of change maker a as well. To always be trying to make waves etc. art is change. \u0026ldquo;Location 394\u0026rdquo;,\u0026ldquo;Art is what we call it when we’re able to create something new that changes someone. No change, no [art]\u0026rdquo; Ok so simply put this definition of art is when you use creativity to ship Something which ends up affecting someone. Like a finished product. Don\u0026rsquo;t be the victim ,\u0026ldquo;Location 412\u0026rdquo;,\u0026quot;“Here we go again” is an easy way to lull yourself into victimhood, a place where the work is no longer up to you.\u0026rdquo; The message is, be active in your work as opposed to passive. ,\u0026ldquo;Location 408\u0026rdquo;,\u0026ldquo;You might have one, too. And that story drives the actions that we take.\u0026rdquo; I think my story in my head is about my high standard of work and i compare that to my daily work. I always seem to want more for my career. Then I wonder if I want too much. be on the hook ,\u0026ldquo;Location 1196\u0026rdquo;,\u0026ldquo;The industrial system has trained us to avoid the hook. Being on the hook means that you can get blamed, and getting blamed means you can get fired for what you did (or didn’t do). For some of us, though, on the hook is the best place to be. It’s on you. It’s on me. Our choice, our turn, our responsibility.\u0026rdquo; What about putting your commitments online so anyone can see if you break the chain. Or what if your accountability device is your roommate who takes your money if you don\u0026rsquo;t put in your promised hours. Is getting fired like when you have someone looking forward to your work but they lose interest because you don\u0026rsquo;t deliver. But also what if you don\u0026rsquo;t yet have someone looking yet , you\u0026rsquo;re still actively looking for a client. Or what if you\u0026rsquo;re just being generous directing your generosity in a specific direction at someone but they say no they don\u0026rsquo;t want it. Did you just get off the hook. There is no muse just do the work ,\u0026ldquo;Location 1202\u0026rdquo;,\u0026ldquo;The practice is choice plus skill plus attitude. We can learn it and we can do it again. We don’t ship the work because we’re creative. We’re creative because we ship the work. No ghost is needed.\u0026rdquo; This also reminds me of the [[person David Goggins]] concept of [[Cookie Jar]] , refer to your track record of accomplishments whenever you need inspiration or motivation. don\u0026rsquo;t be a hack (Don\u0026rsquo;t lose your point of view ) to me this is like \u0026ldquo;compromising too much\u0026rdquo;. ,\u0026ldquo;Location 1240\u0026rdquo;,\u0026ldquo;Go too far to please the audience and you become a hack. Lose your point of view, lose your reason for doing the work, become a hack. Focus only on the results, become a hack.\u0026rdquo; Keeping to your reason for doing the work is the biggest struggle at my day job. It makes me feel like a hack to sometimes or often play a role at work thats boring and uninventive. I have to fight tooth and nail to get work through that i feel is truly worth doing. that paradox \u0026ldquo;generous vision\u0026rdquo; as opposed to being like an autocrat. ,\u0026ldquo;Location 1242\u0026rdquo;,\u0026ldquo;On the other hand, if you ignore what you see and simply create for yourself, you’ve walked away from empathy. If there is no change, there is no art. The professional understands the fine line between showing up with a generous vision and showing up trying to control the outcome. The best way through the paradox is by working. Ship creative work. On a schedule. Without attachment and without reassurance.\u0026rdquo; But again ship creative work okay but what does taking criticism look like. How does the feedback loop look like. And again what if you are using yourself as a proxy for what you think potentially other people would find desirable. the work is the client ,\u0026ldquo;Location 1398\u0026rdquo;,\u0026ldquo;The work is your client. It’s hired you to help you make a change happen. Getting paid for our work can confuse us, because it might seem that all we need to do is serve the person with a check book. But that’s the strategy of a hack—and it rarely leads to the contributions we set out to make in the first place.\u0026rdquo; Ok well when you put it this way it almost reads like if the work is the client and the work is for the client then the work is for work itself haha. But it does take on a life of its own i suppose. being your idiosyncratic self means you\u0026rsquo;re memorable and not replaceable ,\u0026ldquo;Location 1280\u0026rdquo;,\u0026ldquo;Today, the best work and the best opportunities go to those who are hard to replace. The linchpins, the ones who are likely to be missed. And, delightfully, at the very same time that the economy is rewarding idiosyncrasy, we’re discovering that it’s also the way we were meant to be.\u0026rdquo; Idiosyncrasy is memorable. The recipe for the opposite of homogeneity. Fun. Opposite of boring. Doing what you love. Adventure. Breaking the rules. And still making an impact. But the impact, although it is important , needs to be diluted with Whatever makes the work worth doing. ,\u0026ldquo;Location 1309\u0026rdquo;,\u0026ldquo;When the client wants a cheap, easy building, the architect’s desire to do great work is rarely achieved. And when the client wants something important, she knows that hiring a merely good architect is a mistake. It’s tempting to blame the clients. But the commitment to be a great architect also requires the professionalism to do the hard work of getting better clients.\u0026rdquo; Yea for a while I thought it was up to me to challenge people to think bigger and better. I still try but I\u0026rsquo;m thinking more and more you need to find different people not change people. start small ,\u0026ldquo;Location 2065\u0026rdquo;,\u0026ldquo;First, focus on making something worth sharing. How small can you make it and still do something you’re proud of?\u0026rdquo; Ok something worth sharing. So this slightly more cements for me the author believes you will not necessarily have a client as you are starting out. You have things \u0026ldquo;for someone\u0026rdquo; sure. And then you share them. get feedback. This is super important nuance.

Kubernetes is taking quite a while to start up though . several minutes. kind of weird? Download spark image From here 2021-01-24 ok backup my docker images Per notes , I backed up local docker images, Like this\u0026hellip; docker save citibike-learn:0.9 # image:citibike-learn, tag:latest, image-id:1ff5cd891f00 # image:citibike-learn, tag:0.9, imageid:c8d430e84654 Then I did the factory reset. And Enabled Kubernetes and wow! Nice finally got the green light. And restoring with docker load like this docker load -i citibike-learn-0.9.tar Ok now I can continue trying to get spark setup..

So yea none of my Ctrl-C were useful haha. Trying that CLI delete instead then kubectl delete -n default pod spark-pi-df12a57736350578-driver Ok that seems to have worked.

Hmm maybe since i had errors w/ group by , I can try reduceByKey intead? oh actually, when looking at the doc for the group by with help(df.groupBy('sex')) , I read in the apply description that it is depracated and applyInPandas is recommended instead. And in the apache spark doc here , I\u0026rsquo;m reading that \u0026quot; Using PandasUDFType will be deprecated in the future.\u0026quot; so then the complicated decorator looking code I was trying above, maybe that is getting phased out anyway.

Hmm according to here you can commit. post /repos/{owner}/{repo}/git/commits But not seeing how to include the actual diffs in there. Maybe a blob? Ok according to this nice article , indeed the blob endpoint is for files! hmm step 1, get a reference.. like here curl -v -H \u0026#34;Authorization: token ${GITHUB_TOKEN}\u0026#34; https://api.github.com/repos/namoopsoo/namoopsoo.github.io/git/ref/heads/master Nice excellent, \u0026hellip;\n... ... { \u0026#34;ref\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;refs/heads/master\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;node_id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;MDM6UmVmMTAwMTg1NjcwOnJlZnMvaGVhZHMvbWFzdGVy\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://api.github.com/repos/namoopsoo/namoopsoo.github.io/git/refs/heads/master\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;object\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;sha\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;482d52f53a146dd688eff4ed8093cf2980580662\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;commit\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://api.github.com/repos/namoopsoo/namoopsoo.github.io/git/commits/482d52f53a146dd688eff4ed8093cf2980580662\u0026#34; } } step 2 , Grab the commit that HEAD points to curl -H \u0026#34;Authorization: token ${GITHUB_TOKEN}\u0026#34; https://api.github.com/repos/namoopsoo/namoopsoo.github.io/git/commits/482d52f53a146dd688eff4ed8093cf2980580662 { \u0026#34;sha\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;482d52f53a146dd688eff4ed8093cf2980580662\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;node_id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;MDY6Q29tbWl0MTAwMTg1NjcwOjQ4MmQ1MmY1M2ExNDZkZDY4OGVmZjRlZDgwOTNjZjI5ODA1ODA2NjI=\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://api.github.com/repos/namoopsoo/namoopsoo.github.io/git/commits/482d52f53a146dd688eff4ed8093cf2980580662\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;html_url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://github.com/namoopsoo/namoopsoo.github.io/commit/482d52f53a146dd688eff4ed8093cf2980580662\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;author\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Michal Piekarczyk\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;email\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;namoopsoo\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;date\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2020-12-13T21:39:11Z\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;committer\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Michal Piekarczyk\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;email\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;namoopsoo\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;date\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2020-12-13T21:39:11Z\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;tree\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;sha\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;e5a9ee9506a040a7cc8c608614db7531f8f32e70\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://api.github.com/repos/namoopsoo/namoopsoo.github.io/git/trees/e5a9ee9506a040a7cc8c608614db7531f8f32e70\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;message\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;moar\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;parents\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;sha\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;13db6ee453ea2b05d09ed8da1b7baa87fbbdcebc\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://api.github.com/repos/namoopsoo/namoopsoo.github.io/git/commits/13db6ee453ea2b05d09ed8da1b7baa87fbbdcebc\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;html_url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://github.com/namoopsoo/namoopsoo.github.io/commit/13db6ee453ea2b05d09ed8da1b7baa87fbbdcebc\u0026#34; } ], \u0026#34;verification\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;verified\u0026#34;: false, \u0026#34;reason\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;unsigned\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;signature\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;payload\u0026#34;: null } } Ok and the tree sha is important. Reading up on this here Okay after taking a mini detour to understand what a Tree Object is, I think I can keep going now . So a Tree Object is a group of other objects ( blob and or tree objects). So continuing with this article , going to post a blob next 3. Post your new file to the server curl \\ -X POST \\ -H \u0026#34;Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json\u0026#34; \\ -H \u0026#34;Authorization: token ${GITHUB_TOKEN}\u0026#34; https://api.github.com/repos/namoopsoo/namoopsoo.github.io/git/blobs \\ -d \u0026#39;{\u0026#34;content\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;content of the blob\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;encoding\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;utf-8\u0026#34;}\u0026#39; Getting\n{ \u0026#34;message\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Not Found\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;documentation_url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/git#create-a-blob\u0026#34; } Well Not Found is better than permission denied I guess.\nAh actually, .. I took a random guess and looking at https://github.com/settings/tokens indeed found I needed to just add some extra permissions. Tried that same curl -X POST again and now got back { \u0026#34;sha\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;6b2d785ecc7db8b71ee933a5b22961a52f40592c\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://api.github.com/repos/namoopsoo/namoopsoo.github.io/git/blobs/6b2d785ecc7db8b71ee933a5b22961a52f40592c\u0026#34; } So all good.\n4. Get a hold of the tree that the commit points to Ok so grabbing that e5a9ee9506a040a7cc8c608614db7531f8f32e70 tree of my target branch\u0026rsquo;s current HEAD commit now\u0026hellip; ( and incidentally that jq json querying parsing utility is kind of nice here.. ) get /repos/{owner}/{repo}/git/trees/e5a9ee9506a040a7cc8c608614db7531f8f32e70 curl \\ -H \u0026#34;Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json\u0026#34; \\ -H \u0026#34;Authorization: token ${GITHUB_TOKEN}\u0026#34; https://api.github.com/repos/namoopsoo/namoopsoo.github.io/git/trees/e5a9ee9506a040a7cc8c608614db7531f8f32e70 \\ | jq --color-output \u0026#39;.tree | .[0:3]\u0026#39; [ { \u0026#34;path\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;.gitignore\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;mode\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;100644\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;blob\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;sha\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;f40fbd8ba564ea28e0a2501e2921909467b39887\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;size\u0026#34;: 56, \u0026#34;url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://api.github.com/repos/namoopsoo/namoopsoo.github.io/git/blobs/f40fbd8ba564ea28e0a2501e2921909467b39887\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;path\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;404.html\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;mode\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;100644\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;blob\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;sha\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;086a5c9ea988c5a4d37acc5f8ea089e37cb19371\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;size\u0026#34;: 419, \u0026#34;url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://api.github.com/repos/namoopsoo/namoopsoo.github.io/git/blobs/086a5c9ea988c5a4d37acc5f8ea089e37cb19371\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;path\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;CNAME\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;mode\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;100644\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;blob\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;sha\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;922c44a4850e7421585c9030ecd82face732adc6\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;size\u0026#34;: 21, \u0026#34;url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://api.github.com/repos/namoopsoo/namoopsoo.github.io/git/blobs/922c44a4850e7421585c9030ecd82face732adc6\u0026#34; } ] (pandars3) $ curl -H \u0026#34;Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json\u0026#34; -H \u0026#34;Authorization: token ${GITHUB_TOKEN}\u0026#34; https://api.github.com/repos/namoopsoo/namoopsoo.github.io/git/trees/e5a9ee9506a040a7cc8c608614db7531f8f32e70 |jq --color-output \u0026#39;.tree | map(.type)\u0026#39; [ \u0026#34;blob\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;blob\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;blob\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;blob\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;blob\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;tree\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;blob\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;tree\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;tree\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;tree\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;tree\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;tree\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;tree\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;tree\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;tree\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;blob\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;tree\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;blob\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;blob\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;blob\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;blob\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;blob\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;blob\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;blob\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;blob\u0026#34; ] Also noticed the paths dont seem to be absolute paths ..

Chambliss.\nIn three sentences The author has spent a lot of time reporting on all levels of swimming competition and writes about observations about the differences between them.\nThe differences in abilities of different levels of competition are not because of quantitative differences like \u0026ldquo;more training\u0026rdquo; but qualitative differences like using a flip turn instead of just touching the wall and turning around. Qualitative differences narrow to \u0026ldquo;technique\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;discipline\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;attitude\u0026rdquo;.\nImpressions The notion that success is boring or that there are no \u0026ldquo;quick tricks\u0026rdquo; to success is quite like the Jim Collins\u0026rsquo; lessons in \u0026ldquo;Good to Great\u0026rdquo; that there were no \u0026ldquo;turning points\u0026rdquo; in companies distinguished as more successful. Instead, per those companies\u0026rsquo; exit interviews, their internal experience was just a long slog of improvement and so it was only the external observer\u0026rsquo;s view that looked like someone had some amazing insight that turned everything around and saved the day.\nThe idea of \u0026ldquo;being stuck\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;certainly swimmers typically remain within a certain level for most of their careers, maintaining through-out their careers the habits with which they began,\u0026rdquo; I think I have personally felt from time to time with learning piano. Even though I had been a student of the piano now for maybe twenty years, I think I have only recently really started stepping up (last 2-3 years or so). And literally I started learning the Chopin \u0026ldquo;Etudes\u0026rdquo; (or Studies opus 10) since the early part of this year, in which Chopin is known to say that the Etudes were written in a way to force you to un-learn a lot of what you have learned. One insight I pieced together a few months ago was in hitting keys after actually knowing your fingers were in the correct position. That seems kind of obvious, but a lot of my practice in \u0026ldquo;Etude op 10 no 1\u0026rdquo;, I would play multiple notes with a finger (instead of one note per finger) because of the amount of traveling your right hand does on the keyboard. But at one point I think I consciously started to trying making sure my fingers were properly placed and the errors just went down by definition. That did slow down the playing a little bit of course, but also hearing the right sounds is much more pleasurable for myself and anybody listening in the vicinity.\nProbably the biggest take-away from this article is that one must learn from failure faster. You practice in your weak areas and not what you are already good at. You keep on trying things outside of your area of comfort and you seek out feedback. Rinse and repeat.\nQutoes list \u0026ldquo;Simply doing more of the same will not lead to moving up a level in the sport.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The very features of the sport which the C swimmer finds unpleasant, the top level swimmer enjoys. What others see as boring\u0026ndash;swimming back and forth over a black line for two hours, say\u0026ndash;they find peaceful, even meditative, often challenging or therapeutic.\u0026rdquo;\nYea this also reminds me of this concept around that I think is described in the book the \u0026ldquo;Motivation Myth\u0026rdquo; (have not read this yet but I heard a description), that waiting to become motivated to do something you will never get around to it. And that discipline is kind of like short circuiting the gap between idea and action. And most importantly, that you end up liking what you do once you start doing it and getting good.

A protective vaccine was developed within five years of the initial 1984 emergence, but because the production of a \u0026ldquo;live genetically modified vaccine\u0026rdquo; is not yet allowed in the US, the vaccine (and another vaccine for a subsequent \u0026ldquo;RHDV2\u0026rdquo; variant ) cannot be used here except by rare limited emergency requests allowed by the USDA.\nImpressions I didn\u0026rsquo;t know that the rabbit has been in such a complicated undefined state, never having been officially classified as \u0026ldquo;livestock\u0026rdquo; by the USDA, rabbits do not benefit from laws around humane treatment. And prior to World War II, rabbit meat was very popular in the US, because beef was more expensive. However, afterwards, domestic cattle production doubled and through its affordability, beef and also chicken overtook the rabbit. I had no clue. There is also an opinion expressed by the American Rabbit Breeders Association that the 1940 creation of Bugs Bunny contributed to the decline of the rabbit as a food item! The still growing pet rabbit owner enthusiasts in the US have been getting very nervous about RHD and they have successfully but very rarely seen some access to vaccines. However, the greater concern expressed in this article is that rabbits are actually a primary source of protein in America for \u0026ldquo;foxes, bobcats, wolves and hawks\u0026rdquo; and that apart from random cats and dogs (the article specifically mentions \u0026ldquo;poodles\u0026rdquo;), they will have no other source of protein available. And although the USDA has in a handful of some cases agreed to the purchase of these vaccines, unlike the rabbies vaccine which can be given with food, the RHD vaccines can only be injected and must be provided annually.\n","permalink":"https://michal.piekarczyk.xyz/post/2020-11-14-newyorker-rabbitfever-rhd-summary/","summary":"The material source \u0026ldquo;Rabbit Rever\u0026rdquo; by Susan Orlean published in \u0026ldquo;New Yorker\u0026rdquo; in the \u0026ldquo;July 6 2020\u0026rdquo; edition\nThe article in 3 sentences The author writes about how the rabbit, apparently domesticated for hundreds of years now, has been all of livestock, fur source and since mid century a third most popular choice of pet in the US.

I at least remember reading it in a really cold Starbucks in a mall in Tokyo haha. First, the standard template:\nThe book in three sentences Team of Teams is former General Stanley McChrystal\u0026rsquo;s account of his time at the Joint Chiefs of Staff and in his role in the conflict with AQI (Al-Qaeda in Iraq) and Abu Musab al Zarqawi. He captures the information sharing struggles US forces in Iraq had that made them struggle in keeping up with AQI\u0026rsquo;s de-centralized un-command. And he shares the good news of how giving autonomy and decision making to teams stopped central command from being a bottle neck.\nImpressions I have had a mental bias against micro-management from my time on software/data science projects, but I did not know the story of Frederick Winslow Taylor and his notorious stopwatch that he used to optimize the slow steps in steel production work. This is probably one of the most important points in the book, because it is very unintuitive. The impact of standardizing steel work was immediate efficiency, but mantra of \u0026ldquo;management\u0026rdquo; has created a century\u0026rsquo;s worth of demoralized workers. But more importantly the inflexibility McChrystal writes about in the \u0026ldquo;chain of command\u0026rdquo; meant that reconnaissance missions expertly carried out but unconnected to analysts for example, would make time sensitive intel go to waste.\nHow the book changed me I felt aligned with the book from the start so perhaps reading it was a bit of confirmation bias, but I will gladly cherry pick it as evidence of a changing tide of \u0026ldquo;management\u0026rdquo; (referred to as \u0026ldquo;command\u0026rdquo; in this book). Very close in spirit, Eric Colson\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Beware the data science pin factory\u0026rdquo; here, is a bit more validation, but closer to my knowledge space.\nTop three quotes (Find the quote about the trash bag of laptops ) Unsorted Quotes List \u0026ldquo;Team of teams\u0026rdquo; is distinguished from a \u0026ldquo;Command of teams\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;The quandary faced by Brigham and Women’s in 2013, like that faced by our Task Force in 2004, was that of what we might call a “command of teams”: adaptive small teams operating within an old-fashioned rigid superstructure. In a response to rising tactical complexity, many organizations in many domains have replaced small commands with teams.\u0026rdquo; (\u0026ldquo;Location 2304\u0026rdquo;)\n\u0026ldquo;A big piece of why we lagged AQI lay in our need to relay decisions up and down the chain of command. Decisions that senior leaders a few decades prior would have been unable to oversee now required senior approval.\u0026rdquo; (\u0026ldquo;Location 3667\u0026rdquo;)\n\u0026ldquo;Through a series of experiments, Taylor had determined the optimal temperature at which to cut steel chips, the optimal distance between the machinist and his tools, the optimal way for water to cool the lathe, and the optimal speed for internal conveyor belts. When it all came together, there was not a second of lost time, not an ounce of misplaced material, not a moment of unproductive human effort.\u0026rdquo; (\u0026ldquo;Location 704\u0026rdquo;,\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,)\n\u0026ldquo;Shia had an evil brilliance. But ideas are cheap; plenty of armchair generals have proposals for winning wars, some of them quite clever, but only those who can actually shape and manage a force capable of doing the job ultimately succeed.\u0026rdquo; (\u0026ldquo;Location 472\u0026rdquo;)\nTaylor and Scientific Management I am in the middle of reading \u0026ldquo;The Meritocracy Trap\u0026rdquo; right now, and I see a new connection as I am re-reading this quote, about how Taylor apparently said to workers, \u0026ldquo;I have you for your strength and mechanical ability. We have other men paid for thinking.\u0026rdquo; (\u0026ldquo;Location 819\u0026rdquo;). One of the questions I was trying to answer while reading \u0026ldquo;The Meritocracy Trap\u0026rdquo; was how it came to be that there is so much so called \u0026ldquo;unskilled\u0026rdquo; labor today. And putting two and two together here, Taylorism and management theory feel like part of the answer. That book underlined how the influx of the baby boomers forced colleges to more quickly be able to review the new onslaught of applicants and so they introduced Standardized entrace exams. And then it was only a natural follow on that people would stratify in getting better at those entrance exams. But what if the introduction of management was the original stratification sin here, pushing people apart into the skilled and unskilled classes.\nAnd the second element introduced in the \u0026ldquo;Meritocracy Trap\u0026rdquo; was technology/automation as a means of how for example a ride-share driver (e.g. Uber) no longer needs to figure out how to take a passenger from point A to B, but an algorithm does this work. (Not to mention the future of self driving cars). There are countless other examples of this of course. Today you can take a photo of a suspicious mole on your skin with your phone and a melanoma algorithm will assign a likelihood of malignancy to your photograph. We need doctors to build those labeled datasets of course, but maybe that ends up being a research specialty and perhaps some of the cheapness diagnostics displaces some jobs here.\nTo connect this back to the topic of this summary, teams are great of course, but the unskilled laborforce does now look like a mob of elephants in the room asking us whether those teams can outperform the algorithms in the combat of the future. And that goes for \u0026ldquo;military\u0026rdquo; combat or for entrepreneurial combat or say in the league of medical care. Will teams of nurses be replaced by teams of nurses plus algorithms.\n","permalink":"https://michal.piekarczyk.xyz/post/2020-11-12-team-of-teams-summary/","summary":"I was reading Team of Teams sometime around September 2019.

And here is a visual look at some of the new features I explored including.\nAgain, the data looks like this\n\u0026#34;tripduration\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;starttime\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;stoptime\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;start station id\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;start station name\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;start station latitude\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;start station longitude\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;end station id\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;end station name\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;end station latitude\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;end station longitude\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;bikeid\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;usertype\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;birth year\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;gender\u0026#34; \u0026#34;171\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;10/1/2015 00:00:02\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;10/1/2015 00:02:54\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;388\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;W 26 St \u0026amp; 10 Ave\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;40.749717753\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;-74.002950346\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;494\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;W 26 St \u0026amp; 8 Ave\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;40.74734825\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;-73.99723551\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;24302\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;Subscriber\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;1973\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;1\u0026#34; \u0026#34;593\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;10/1/2015 00:00:02\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;10/1/2015 00:09:55\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;518\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;E 39 St \u0026amp; 2 Ave\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;40.74780373\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;-73.9734419\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;438\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;St Marks Pl \u0026amp; 1 Ave\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;40.72779126\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;-73.98564945\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;19904\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;Subscriber\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;1990\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;1\u0026#34; \u0026#34;233\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;10/1/2015 00:00:11\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;10/1/2015 00:04:05\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;447\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;8 Ave \u0026amp; W 52 St\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;40.76370739\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;-73.9851615\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;447\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;8 Ave \u0026amp; W 52 St\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;40.76370739\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;-73.9851615\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;17797\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;Subscriber\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;1984\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;1\u0026#34; \u0026#34;250\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;10/1/2015 00:00:15\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;10/1/2015 00:04:25\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;336\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;Sullivan St \u0026amp; Washington Sq\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;40.73047747\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;-73.99906065\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;223\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;W 13 St \u0026amp; 7 Ave\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;40.73781509\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;-73.99994661\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;23966\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;Subscriber\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;1984\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;1\u0026#34; \u0026#34;528\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;10/1/2015 00:00:17\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;10/1/2015 00:09:05\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;3107\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;Bedford Ave \u0026amp; Nassau Ave\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;40.72311651\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;-73.95212324\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;539\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;Metropolitan Ave \u0026amp; Bedford Ave\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;40.71534825\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;-73.96024116\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;16246\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;Customer\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;0\u0026#34; \u0026#34;440\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;10/1/2015 00:00:17\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;10/1/2015 00:07:37\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;3107\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;Bedford Ave \u0026amp; Nassau Ave\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;40.72311651\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;-73.95212324\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;539\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;Metropolitan Ave \u0026amp; Bedford Ave\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;40.71534825\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;-73.96024116\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;23698\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;Customer\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;0\u0026#34; TOC Prior probability baseline Xgboost detour Multi class classification notes How does this time compare with the previous attempt Model highlights Gluing everything together Looking at hyperparameter tuning results Follow on Prior probability baseline Here, I first wanted to get a metric baseline using a simple model which only uses the highest prior probability destination as the prediction for a source bike share station. Anything even slightly more sophisticated should perform better. I also used this opportunity to apply multi class logloss as an evaluation metric for this problem, which I had not tried last time. So for an output probability vector of 54 possible destination stations, log loss can more granularly assess the prediction probabilities against a vector of the correct station, [0, 1, 0, 0, 0,...] compared to just accuracy.\nFor example\nfrom sklearn.metrics import log_loss # and some noisy predictions noisy_pred = np.array([[.05, .05, .9], [.95, 0.05, 0], [.9, 0.1, 0], [0.05, .05, .9], [0, 1, 0]]) log_loss([3, 1, 1, 3, 2], noisy_pred) the output here is 0.07347496827220674, which is just slightly worse than the perfect 0., showing that log loss can be handy for comparing models.\nThe detail is in the notes, but basically the cross validation log loss using this method ended up being\narray([29.03426394, 25.61716199, 29.19083979, 28.312853 , 22.04601817]) Dockerization Next, for repeatability and portability, here I re-adapted some earlier Dockerization I had setup before to wrap xgboost, along with jupyter notebook for experimentation. This was crucial, because if you want to jump between some quick experiments on your laptop and a notebook in the cloud, you don\u0026rsquo;t want to deal with strange differences in library dependencies between MacOs and linux.\nXgboost detour To start, I wanted to better understand how to use Xgboost abilities with respect to training a model, putting it down, saving it to disk, loading it again and continuing to train on new data. I had used this capability in Tensorflow land earlier and I read it might be possible with Xgboost, but even after trial and error with both the main Xgboost API and its scikit learn API, I could not get this to work properly. My notes on this are here in an earlier post.\nOne cool thing I did learn however was that when repeating a model train and evaluation experiment with both the functional API and the scikit learn API, the functional API took advantage of multithreading, and produced a particular result in 4min 18s vs 49min 6s, with both models using the same seed=42 and ending up with the same accuracy and log loss on some held out data.\nAs I mentioned here , I experienced some early problems running out of memory and crashing, for instance computing log los son 843416 rows. And that is why I was seeking out approaches of online learning. But because of the limitations, my workout ended up being the use of at least carefully deleting objects in memory with del to free up space for, between preprocessing, training and validation. And I also played around with the approach of initializing a xgb.DMatrix using the xgb.DMatrix('/my/blah/path#dtrain.cache') syntax where you specify # a cache file to allow for file access to reduce the in-memory burden, also requiring to dump your pre-processed training data to file first. (And doing that is good anyway because it allows you to free up that precious memory).\nCompared to the initial baseline logloss from earlier of around 29, here I noted a result of 3.9934347 with the initial xgboost approach.\nOn 2020-06-14, I tried using the xgboost caching with the scikitlearn api approach. In the meantime I also ran into a fun issue where an xgboost model was trained on data without a particular output class , with only 53 classes in fact and would produce predict probability vectors of length 53 instead of 54, so I ended up having to make sure to better shuffle the data to make sure when trying to use less data (when using cross validation for instance) that all of the output classes are accounted for, without having a more direct way of telling Xgboost what the output classes should be.\nAlso another fun Tensorflow comparison was I got XGBoostError: need to call fit or load_model beforehand when trying to call predict on a bare model that had not undergone training. Whereas with Tensorflow, I experienced in a previous project that this is absolutely fine, because you simply have a fully formed neural network with some randomly (or otherwise) initialized weights. But with xgboost, or at least the particular implementation I was using, this is not possible, because there is no notion of a base model.\nHere, I tried cutting up the training data like\nclf = xgb.XGBClassifier() workdir = fu.make_work_dir(); print(workdir) fu.log(workdir, \u0026#39;Starting\u0026#39;) prev_model = None loss_vec = []; acc_vec = [] for i, part in enumerate(tqdm(parts)): clf.fit(X_transformed[part], y_enc[part], xgb_model=prev_model) fu.log(workdir, f\u0026#39;[{i}] Done fit\u0026#39;) prev_model = f\u0026#39;{workdir}/model.xg\u0026#39; clf.save_model(prev_model) y_prob_vec = clf.predict_proba(X_test_transformed) fu.log(workdir, f\u0026#39;[{i}] Done predict_proba\u0026#39;) loss = fu.big_logloss(y_test_enc, y_prob_vec, labels) fu.log(workdir, f\u0026#39;[{i}] Done big_logloss, loss={loss}.\u0026#39;) loss_vec.append(loss) acc = accuracy_score(y_test_enc, np.argmax(y_prob_vec, axis=1)) acc_vec.append(acc) fu.log(workdir, f\u0026#39;[{i}] Done accuracy, acc={acc}.\u0026#39;) to see if the scikit learn API can allow saving and restoring previously trained models and continuing, with the fit(X, xgb_model=prev_model) syntax, but the output performance data was basically random indicating to me that the fit was starting from scratch each time.\nHere, below, is a plot of accuracy after multiple epochs, just to visually show the lack of any progression. (This plot is from a similar experiment in my 2020-06-16 notebook ).\nSo basically I gave up on this approach for using xgboost.\nAlso in that notebook, I found I was oddly getting 0 logloss during some experimentation because I had like in this toy example below, been specifying labels to the log_loss func, not matching the actual y_true data (which is the first arg).\na, b = np.array([0, 0, 0]), np.array([[0, 0., 0], [0., 0, 0], [0., 0, 0]]) print(log_loss(a, b, labels=[\u0026#39;a\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;b\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;c\u0026#39;])) # =\u0026gt; 0.0 2020-06-19 Here , because a lot of the test set prediction for model evaluation takes time I ended up creating a mini parallelization func. I verified that it was producing roughly the same validation and the time to execute was less.\nI also wrote about how I had needed to use less data to avoid crashing, using the pandas sample() func like,\ntripsdf = pd.read_csv(f\u0026#39;{datadir}/2013-07 - Citi Bike trip data.csv\u0026#39; ).sample(frac=0.017, random_state=42) but that it would be better to build a more balanced dataset instead of just random sampling.\nA rapid fire list of some additional experiments Here, I had another training attempt using the so called \u0026ldquo;cache data\u0026rdquo; with functional api. (But finding especially here that the max_depth was not changing so likely no learning was happening). Here I aadded new features here for a \u0026lsquo;v2\u0026rsquo; dataset, including weekday. and time_of_day. Added this in a new module, fresh/preproc/v2.py. Here , more memory struggles (especially since I added more data). Here, describing that after lots of crashing, starting to use numpy append mode, here , to allow for doing preprocessing in chunks. And starting to look at target class distribution. Here I\u0026rsquo;m discovering that it is quite possible that this caching is only allowed w/ the \u0026ldquo;libsvm\u0026rdquo; format! And here, I see hmm it is kind of weird, that with cache, without\u0026hellip; producing different feature_names ? more kernel dying! Here , bigger box? Here , class distribution for size reduction and dataset rebalancing. Here ok I took the result from the balancing/shrinking concept from the \u0026ldquo;2020-06-29.ipynb\u0026rdquo; notebook and tried to use less data see if we can avoid a kernel crash that happened in \u0026ldquo;2020-06-28-take2.ipynb\u0026rdquo;. Here I wanted to do a quick recalc of yesterday\u0026rsquo;s model using the sklearn API Again. Here, more rebalancing. Here. Here, end result: compared with \u0026ldquo;2020-07-03-aws.md\u0026rdquo; , I am not really seeing much of a difference. the balanced test accuracy perhaps looks every so slightly better but probably not significantly. Here , change up 'subsample' and 'max_depth', measuring logloss, accuracy and balanced_accuracy , there are some noticable changes in logloss, but overall the changes are probably not significant. Here. Here. Here. Here. Multi class classification notes Notes on multi class classification Understanding tuning results hyper parameter tuning and train/test acc\nPreviously vs This time Last time around, I segmented the starting data into 24 hour-long segments. This time, I segmented time into only 5 bins to make the model slightly more generalizable. # time_of_day 0: 6-9, 1: 10-13, 2: 14-16, 3: 17-21, 4: 22-0, 0-5 Actually after picking these bins arbitrarily, I ended up also looking at the time of day histograms here and the peaks look close to what I had as a mental model in my mind. It might be interesting try some other bins at some point later.\nOne other new feature this time is the binary weekday feature, specifying weekday vs weekend.\nThe starting neighborhood one hot encoded was kept as an input.\nAlso last time around, the main model was a Random Forest classifier, but using XGBoost this time.\nModel Highlights The top model has these stats\u0026hellip;\n(pandars3) $ docker run -p 8889:8889 -p 8080:8080 -i -t -v $(pwd):/opt/program \\ -v ${MY_LOCAL_DATA_DIRECTORY}:/opt/data \\ -v ~/Downloads:/opt/downloads \\ -v $(pwd)/artifacts/2020-08-19T144654Z:/opt/ml \\ citibike-learn:latest \\ import fresh.predict_utils as fpu bundle = fpu.load_bundle_in_docker() In [7]: bundle[\u0026#39;model_bundle\u0026#39;][\u0026#39;bundle\u0026#39;][\u0026#39;validation_metrics\u0026#39;] Out[7]: {\u0026#39;accuracy\u0026#39;: 0.12171455130090014, \u0026#39;balanced_accuracy\u0026#39;: 0.10451301995291779, \u0026#39;confusion\u0026#39;: array([[415, 64, 4, ..., 0, 103, 69], [ 56, 541, 4, ..., 0, 130, 27], [ 23, 10, 136, ..., 0, 16, 130], ..., [ 2, 0, 2, ..., 1, 3, 36], [151, 222, 3, ..., 0, 260, 35], [ 84, 25, 46, ..., 0, 29, 861]]), \u0026#39;logloss\u0026#39;: 3.4335361255637977, \u0026#39;test\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;/home/ec2-user/SageMaker/learn-citibike/artifacts/2020-07-08T143732Z/test.libsvm\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;karea\u0026#39;: 0.760827309330065} More on the \u0026ldquo;k-area\u0026rdquo; metric is here Top Model\u0026rsquo;s Top Fscore features Extracting from this notebook ,\n.dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; } And it can be interesting to look at a random tree from xgboost too sometimes, again extracting from the above mentioned notebook.\nGluing everything together In this notebook, I face the challenges of taking the model from bundle to a demo site. There were a lot of challenges involved. My concept was to use the Google Static Map API to display the top neighborhood predictions. Hitting this API properly did take a little bit of time, but it was not that bad. And later on, I updated the whole AWS Lambda approach so the lambda function calls the API with the result from the dockerized SageMaker served model.\nAdmittedly, the most time consuming part was figuring out the API Gateway Cognito \u0026ldquo;Unauthenticated Authentication\u0026rdquo;. AWS has this Cognito service which manages user/password based authentication for you but it also lets you use Anonymous authentication. But there must be a lot of degrees of freedom in how this is used, because I could not find good documentation on how to set this up properly for my usecase at all.\nI had used API Gateway for authentication through CORS in the past and I recalled a bit of nuance that for example you may have setup CORS properly for 200 status codes, but if your program crashes with a 500 then your browser will scream about a CORS error, because the response is not returning the expected allow-origin-blah header. In the past this had taken me a while to figure out, but now I luckily had that knowledge in my back pocket. In any case, it is worth it for the serverless approach.\nAutomation made the process very convenient https://github.com/namoopsoo/learn-citibike/blob/master/notes/2020-06-07-local-docker-notes.md\nI also described my build process in the earlier mentioned glue notes too. With so many tweaks to the python side, the model and the javascript side, being able to build and deploy with quick make style commands made everything faster.

And in the notes I plotted feature importances against accuracy for all of them.\nFor example, here are some of the more interesting plots,\nThe point here is that I had one hot encoded all of the starting neighborhoods. I am hoping of course that if a particular starting location looks important, then that should mean it is important in discriminating where you go next. Meaning it narrows down where you go. On the other hand, if your starting location is boring then that should mean it is more like a hub and there are too many destinations for the start along to be a helpful feature.\nIn the above plots, there is a wide range of models and they are showing that for some reason high importance does not necessarily mean high accuracy. If anything, I want to make a mental note that maybe these kinds of plots can be indicators of something wrong and some kind of under-fitting in particular. Or weak fitting at least. And one of the other scenarios is that fitting is weak, because there is not enough entropy in the data available to yield helpful discrimination with a model. No matter how well XGBoost can extract information, if the raw material does not have any diamonds, then we will be stuck.\nThe other thought is that there is an overfitting danger around not just an imbalance in the target variable (aka the destination neighborhood) but an imbalance in the starting locations too. This is why it would be really interesting to also look at the entropy of the multiclass outputs for signs of clear uncertainty for specific examples. Putting a pin on this in the follow-on section\nThe time of day features look like this, below, but again, this is not to say that these views represent the full story.\nThinking about this abit more in retrospect, these particular representations are probably not very meaningful to look at because if there are trends they need to be looked at \u0026ldquo;localizing\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;fixing\u0026rdquo; some of the parameters. Because these representations are all over the place but the relationship may still be hidden inside.\nI think one of the top follow ons has to be to find better time of day splits. I chose my time of day splits based on a model in my head, and so there is definitely some room for exploration here.\nFollow On Time of day more splitting exploration Find some more interesting techniques to try out different segmentation of the time of day. ( I\u0026rsquo;m thinking \u0026ldquo;adaptive binning \u0026quot; as described here )\nBetter understanding of model uncertainty As discussed in the feature importances section, it would be really interesting to take the test dataset and for the output probability vectors of all of the examples, to calculate the multi-class entropy, to see if indeed high uncertainty is associated with worse correctness rank (kth accuracy and karea in other terminology I have been using). Of course this is really tricky from an Active Learning point of view, because I can see a scenario where adding more training examples around the cases which have a higher uncertainty may improve the accuracy for the related test examples , but that feels like there is a risk of overfitting to the test set. In any case, however, if the live data is not reflective of the training/test data distributions ( covariate shift ), then refreshing the model is important. Some lessons for the future Approach to training and artifacts Training and hyperparameter tuning takes a long time. Dumping artifacts along the way, including models and results (for example using json), is helpful to allow another notebook to actively monitor the results as they are running. And doing this is also helpful because notebooks that run long experiments can sometimes crash. So it is nice to save intermediary results.\nNotebooks I like the concept of keeping a daily notebook, because keeping several experiments in one notebook can risk running out of memory and sometimes it is difficult to load large notebooks on github, even if they are turned into markdown, if there are a lot of images.\nWrite sooner rather than later Although it is tempting to just keep trying more and more experiments and to keep iterating the frontier forward, I think a difficult lesson to learn is that putting together the results of the day or the week takes much more time when done weeks or months later. I think summarizing and discussing your results as you go along is way more useful. But if you do wait, another idae is to just create a notebook table of concents as I am doing below, as a way of having quick chronological reference about the work that was done. Notebooks TOC 2020-07-10 , like \u0026ldquo;2020-07-09-aws\u0026rdquo; , another hyperparameter tuning round here. max_depth , subsample , colsample_bytree . 2020-07-11 , here I plot a bunch of results (on my laptop) , from the 2020-07-10 notebook running on aws. 2020-07-16-local.md , recalculataing train metrics for the ~1250 or so models from the hyper parameter tuning session 2020-07-26-feature-importances.md , looking at feature importances , reverse engineering my proc_bundle , to get back my list of feature names, which I had not done originally. Initially trying model.get_score() , dumping from each model. This actually took 3.5 hours. I plotted features and accuracy in a few ways to try to gauge features being more oftan associated with high accuracy models. Plotting the correlation of feature importance and acuracy. I think this was not a super useful method. Ultimately, the fscore approach was better 2020-08-05-woe.md , EDA on the time_of_day feature, visual histogram comparisons. Not the most fruitful however. 2020-08-17-bundle-glue.md 2020-08-18-glue.md some reverse engineering to repurpose my preprocessor bundle for live etraffic. And combining preprocessor and model to make a joblib bundle with everything in it. And drafint a full_predict method. 2020-08-22-static-map-api.md getting setup with the Google Static Map API . Very nice. 2020-08-25-glue.md Docker entry code end to end live code. And building the code for the lambda that calls Docker. Unfortunately xgboost does not fit on the lambda. And oops lambda cannot write to the file system. And working through the new API Gateway authentication methods here. I wrote some support code for quick lambda deployment because I ended up using many iterations to get this right. Content type weirdness. Javascript plus cognito. This was not documented very well, so a lot of blundering here. Can\u0026rsquo;t believe I finally made all of this work. This was insane. 2020-10-20-karea-worst.md K Area worst case scenario. 2020-10-21-look-at-model-plot.md looking at Fscore and as well as plotting individual trees with graphviz . Also some interesting issues with versions of xgboost in docker and lack of backward compatibility. 2020-10-21-uncertainty-xgboost.md this is mainly just a footnote about the idea around measuring uncertainty in xgboost. But this is likely not super reliable. 2020-10-22-features-v3.md Take a quick look at time of day distribution 2020-10-23-quick-new-v3-proc-bundle.md one more model iteration using new features. 2020-10-25.md evaluate new v3. But although not yet done any tuning, so far this does not seem significantly better, with karea 0.761 versus earlier best 0.760 karea.

There is a lot to write about and I want to just start getting it out.\nQuick outline The logloss upper bound Does the \u0026ldquo;k area\u0026rdquo; metric help? training balancing Is it possible to calculate the Bayesian error rate here? And logloss seems to be very sensitive. (can look at correlations , not super high) So what metric should be used ? And re-calc that train error so I can compare against test error to understand level of bias/variance The logloss upper bound Training set accuracy and test set accuracy have intuitive boundaries, between 0 and 1, but logloss does not feel intuitive.\nWhat are some theoretical bad logloss outcomes? How do I know model candidates are doing anything useful at all?\nIn an earlier notebook I calculated logloss w/ random data and got 4.29 , discussing random_logloss and uniform_logloss here . In general, logloss maybe it has a theoretical worst case basically . Filling equal likelihoods for all output probabilities gave a logloss of 3.98.\nMaking contrived probability vectors off by 1 class from the correct answers here yielded logloss of 34.538 regardless of which the wrong class was. So indeed logloss does not care about the order.\nAlso, in a different approach for a baseline logloss, in one of the earlier notebooks here , I created a model which just returned the softmax output of the destination tallies for all of the source neighborhoods. With a 5 fold cross validation, this produced validation logloss values of array([29.03426394, 25.61716199, 29.19083979, 28.312853 , 22.04601817]) which is somehow way worse than random! I think this shows that in general perhaps the usefulness of logloss is not great as an evaluation metric for a super large number of classes (in this case 54). This finding feels erratic.\nThe k area metric In the notebook here I have been evaluating some of the results of a multi day hyper parameter tuning session that has been running in here. ( First mini tuning session also here ).\nI started discussing this here.\nAlso, first started calculating some of this data in this notebook\nThe idea is if we want to compare two models predicting multi-class probabilities, in an ideal world, the accuracy will be good enough. But when the number of classes is really high (in this case 54), we will be looking at very low accuracies. And accuracy only looks at the top class. You can also look at the \u0026ldquo;Top k=5 accuracy\u0026rdquo;, or the \u0026ldquo;Top k=10 accuracy\u0026rdquo;, meaning whether the target class is in the top k=5 or top k=10 ranked probabilities.\nInstead you can create a single number between 0 and 1 by accumulating the ranked probabilities\nIf you plot, for all of the examples in a test set, what is the k required to get the correct answer you get this distribution,\nThis looks good in the sense the numbers are higher for lower k.\nAnd the cumulative distribution looks like this\nSo the k area metric is the area under this second curve. The fewer k we need to find the correct answer, the larger the area under this figure. This feels a bit more intuitive of a metric for evaluating classifiers with many many classes, at least compared to logloss!\nExtending notes on k-area Earlier notes on this metric are here The genesis was basically that logloss doesn\u0026rsquo;t care about the rank a model gives to each class probability. This metric is an idea of how to capture roughly how early in the output probabilities does a multi-class model capture the correct answer. The k-area metric is a number from 0 to (num_classes-1)/num_classes , which is the area under the curve of the \u0026ldquo;cumulative rank accuracy\u0026rdquo; , based on the rank of the correct predictions in a model\u0026rsquo;s multi-class probabilities.

Without balancing, highly imbalanced training sets end up producing classifiers that do disproportionately better with the majority or plurality classes.\nIn the note book \u0026ldquo;2020-06-29.md\u0026rdquo; notebook, I worked on a balancing/shrinking concept . Hopefully I can take these concepts and use them in the future as well. I tried to write this balancing code in a somewhat re-usable way.\nIn the \u0026ldquo;2020-07-03-aws.md\u0026rdquo; notebook, I also added some \u0026ldquo;shrinkage\u0026rdquo; because of my Jupyter kernel crashing. The other useful concept is how much data do we really need? Obviously if there is too much data and it crashes the notebook (as here for example ) , but I think this \u0026ldquo;balanced shrinkage\u0026rdquo; concept is interesting to explore just to be more efficient in for example use of hyper parameter tuning time. If you can perhaps \u0026ldquo;boil down\u0026rdquo; your data reducing its size by 50% and if the dev/test set error does not change much then in principle that can save a lot of hyper parameter tuning time, where you may be training/predicting hundreds of models.\nAnd here \u0026ldquo;2020-07-08-aws.md\u0026rdquo; I have another version of balancing that is less aggressive. The first iteration of balancing I was using sort of flipped the proportions. It dramatically (proportionally) weighed down the majority class (too much). This second iteration tries to just bring the plurality classes down closer to the \u0026ldquo;equal share\u0026rdquo; each class should get .\nBut surprisingly, in \u0026ldquo;2020-07-08-aws.md\u0026rdquo; the \u0026ldquo;balanced test accuracy\u0026rdquo; did not improve much.\ntest acc 0.12198962315156459 test balanced acc 0.1044572104146026 logloss 3.4794945441534866 Also in past projects I had balanced out a \u0026ldquo;groomed\u0026rdquo; test set myself but this time I just tried using balanced_accuracy_score from sklearn.\nI think visualizing the confusion is pretty interesting too in multiclass problems like this one from \u0026ldquo;2020-07-03-aws.md\u0026rdquo;, where I had noted the last class (bright yellow!) is sort of taking over the color spectrum of this data, because it is in the 1000 range but all the other data appears to be below 200.\nAnd as a proof of concept my confusion visualization from 2020-07-05-aws-two ,\nis showing the evidence of no balancing at all, because we see the classifier is focused on predicting basically one class, what looks like class 8 or 9.\nAnd the corresponding metrics for that classifier are\nlogloss 3.282076793024198 acc 0.15964601098390355 balanced acc 0.08281646671786597 which helps to show that when acc and balanced acc are far from each other, then the acc probably cannot be trusted.\nUltimately what is a good metric Because balanced acc and acc correlate so highly, the choice between those does not matter so much, as long as the input training data is somewhat balanced, since as we see in the above result, if acc is considerably higher than balanced acc then we probably even cannot trust the logloss. So perhaps checking that acc and balanced acc are close is a good \u0026ldquo;meta metric\u0026rdquo; at first.\nLogloss vs acc, that is an interesting choice.\nWith hyper parameter tuning, we can look at a lot of results and see how these all compare.\nI write about some hyper parameter tuning result here\nBut ultimately I think k area is a more granular measure than simple accuracy.\n","permalink":"https://michal.piekarczyk.xyz/post/2020-07-13-multi-multi-class/","summary":"Summary Here is an early draft of a post, trying to extract some of the insights from the project here.

I want to just jot down some ad hoc thoughts here.\nThis is mainly around navigating XGBoost.\nThere are two XGBoost APIs With the sklearn API you can\nimport xgboost as xgb from xgboost import XGBClassifier import numpy as np from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, log_loss X, y = np.random.random(size=(1000, 3)), np.random.choice([1, 0], size=(1000,), replace=True) X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y) model = XGBClassifier().fit(X_train, y_train) y_pred_prob = model.predict_proba(X_test) y_pred = np.argmax(y_pred_prob, axis=1) acc = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred) print(acc) And you can also just\nparams = {\u0026#39;max_depth\u0026#39;: 2, \u0026#39;eta\u0026#39;: 1, \u0026#39;objective\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;binary:logistic\u0026#39;} dtrain = xgb.DMatrix(X_train, labels=y_train) dtest = xgb.DMatrix(X_test) bst = xgb.train(params, dtrain, num_round=2) y_pred = bst.predict(dtest) The sklearn API I believe uses 100 rounds/iterations/epochs (I have seen these used interchangeably) by default, and the xg.train method let\u0026rsquo;s you specify that. I am not sure how to override that w/ the sklearn wrapper.\nThe sklearn API starts you off with a bunch of default parameters that appear to be different than the raw parameters.\nLearning continuation is not a good method for batch learning I tried to split up my data into chunks and use this approach to batch learn..\ndef batch_train(X, y) parts = [range(1000), range(1000, 2000), range(2000, 3000)] prev_model_loc = None model = XGBClassifier() for i, part in enumerate(parts): model.fit(X[part], y[part], xgb_model=prev_model_loc) prev_model_loc = f\u0026#39;model.xg\u0026#39; model.save_model(prev_model_loc) return model With about half a million rows, training was doable in one go and it took maybe 7 minutes. But when I tried to \u0026ldquo;batch\u0026rdquo; this into 10k sections, this lasted for 8 hours . Luckily I was sleeping and kept my laptop on with Amphetamine, but indeed that was crazy.\nThis answer around pickling/unpickling seems to even say incremental learning with the sklearn API is not possible. So indeed I feel like I want to try it with the functional API.\nI am thinking the lesson is the data caching approach mentioned here for example, is the way to go, but I have not been able to find how to use it with the sklearn api.\nI tried that in my notebook here but my results were very different. I think this was something to do with a very different set of default parameters.\nOr something tells me using num_rounds=2 could have been the culprit. I would like to retry this with more rounds! (In next section I did try num_rounds=100 but that did not help )\nSomehow the caching feature is not mentioned in this blogpost .\nUsing the functional Xgboost api with caching seems to be hit or miss I did try the functional xgboost api w/ num_rounds=100 in this notebook , although it feels like something\u0026rsquo;s wrong. The verbose xgboost output looks like no learning is happening. Going to have to try to pick that apart. According to the parameters documentation , as far as the \u0026ldquo;tree construction algorithm\u0026rdquo; goes, \u0026ldquo;Experimental support for external memory is available for approx and gpu_hist.\u0026rdquo; for the tree_method parameters.\nLater on here I can see learning does happen as long as that \u0026ldquo;cache\u0026rdquo; feature is not used. Indeed very odd.\nParallelism One anecdote around parallelism. In these two notebooks, 2020-07-03-aws and 2020-07-04-aws, I used the same data and same xgboost parameters except in the first go I used the functional API and in the second go I used the sklearn API.\nAmazingly, the accuracy and logloss on the test set was exactly the same to several decimal places in the two cases (I passed seed=42 in both cases as a parameter but I didn\u0026rsquo;t expect such a high level of determinism!).\nThe walltime difference was 4min 18s vs 49min 6s ! (What a difference multithreading makes!)\nThe first case used 2 threads. I didn\u0026rsquo;t actually set the nthread parameter, but I read in the docs it defaults to the max. The sklearn doc seems to show n_jobs is the equivalent parameter here, but it does not appear to describe the default.\nNicely, the magic func %%time shows the parallelization as\nCPU times: user 8min 24s, sys: 1.24 s, total: 8min 26s Wall time: 4min 18s vs\nCPU times: user 49min 10s, sys: 1.15 s, total: 49min 11s Wall time: 49min 6s Side note In the multiclass problem I have here, this is really making me think of the difference between winner take all political elections vs proportional representation elections, as binary vs multi-label problems.

I try to give some high lights from my various notebook entries. ( github )\nMy High Level Recap This physiology data classification challenge poses the question, given this time series voltage data of pilots\u0026rsquo; respiration, electrocardiograms (ecg heart data), galvanic skin response (gsr), electroencephalography (eeg brain brain data) can something reliable be said about their physiological state? My response was to use this as an opportunity to learn about TensorFlow and LSTMs. I quickly discovered that data processing around time series data is 3 dimensional as opposed to typical 2 dimensional data. That means that the harmless 1.1 GiB of training data can quickly multiply to roughly 256 GiB if one is interested in using a 256 long sequence window. That means I learned a lot more about numpy for its simplicity around transforming 3 dimensional data. I had to adapt to using h5py chunks of data so as not to run out of memory quickly and not wait endless hours for training sessions to merely crash. As for TensorFlow and LSTMs, I did not realize right away but LSTMs (and likely neural nets in general) are quite sensitive to data that is not scaled and my logloss ended up reducing when I applied scaling techniques. Raw matplotlib became more intuitive for helping to visualize not just the time series data itself, but also for plotting logloss while training, across batches . . My Jupyter Notebook hygiene and workflow got better really quickly too, because I needed a reliable tool for distinguishing one day\u0026rsquo;s experiment from another\u0026rsquo;s without mixing the together the data or the models.\nThis dataset was highly skewed in terms of classes and so one of the really important preprocessing tasks was creating both balanced training \u0026ldquo;techniques\u0026rdquo; and balanced test data for more uniformly judging model performance. And I say \u0026ldquo;techniques\u0026rdquo;, because I tried both balanced weights and balanced training sets. I ended up preferring balanced training datasets, because that meant less preprocessing code.\nThe picture of Kaggle data I had in my head was clean datasets, but this dataset had one huge problem in that the time series data was not actually sorted by, you know, time. But in a way it is always fun to deal with messy data because it makes you more engaged with it and still more curious in the outcomes.\nIn general this project has given me a lot of fun memories.\nOne day after already getting deep into my LSTM approach, I decided to look through the Kaggle discussions for this project and I found that most people actually stuck to gradient boosting machines like lightGBM or XGBoost. But I decided to follow my personal motto of taking the path less traveled so I kept going with the LSTM .\nI have spent I think half a year of weekends on this problem. I have memories of learning about neural network architecture learning \u0026ldquo;capacity\u0026rdquo; at my niece\u0026rsquo;s birthday party. I came to understand that creating a larger network can cause it to memorize more as opposed to generalize .\nI remember tweaking my stochastic gradient descent batch size after reading this Yann LeCun tweet , \u0026ldquo;Training with large minibatches is bad for your health. More importantly, it\u0026rsquo;s bad for your test error. Friends dont let friends use minibatches larger than 32.\u0026rdquo; .\nI also have memories of starting modeling experiments before going on runs and before going to sleep, so that I could let TensorFlow spin its wheels while I took my mind into strategy mode or just let myself meditate.\nAt one point I was at the Boston Amtrak terminal waiting for my bus, getting deeper into why it is handy to look at raw logit data coming out of a model, especially in a multiclass problem because it can show how strongly a model classifies each class. But applying the logistic function or a softmax is of course good for sussing out probabilities. But then I realized I was waiting for a bus at an Amtrak terminal and I had to sprint several blocks to actually catch my bus!\nAt the end of the day I think of all of the amazing things I could one day do with this kind of technology, such as classifying music or building a chat bot (maybe even one that can tell jokes).\nTable of Contents Quick intro to the data The data is weirdly partially sorted Trickiness of the how the data is laid out (crews and seats?!)

In the process of visualizing data, I had been using matplot lib to visualize the four different classes of events, 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D' as red, green, blue and cyan. That way I could potentially try to get an intuition around the visual cues around state transitions. But at one point I had accidentally been combining the data of multiple people.\nAbove, extracting a plot from my 2019-10-26 notebook, is an example of where I plot combined multi seat data by accident. At one point this was weirding me out. But I realized finally that I had been combining the data of multiple people.\nFor diagram above (^^) , I had written a quick function produce_plots_for_col for plotting four features simultaneously, given a pandas dataframe, some features and an interval, but indeed the zig zag plot was a bit baffling for a bit.\nstart = 3400; produce_plots_for_col(df, [\u0026#39;r\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;ecg\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;gsr\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;eeg_fp1\u0026#39;], range(start,start+150)) When I look back at my notebook I wrote about how I was very dumbfounded when I realized I combined them by accident. The data is complicated however. It includes four indexing columns: id , time , crew and seat . And indeed being careful with splitting this was key in creating good datasets.\nSome more visual inspection in my 2019-06-08 notebook I used another nice quick visual inspection technique, looking at some time series data samples at the four classes, Building datasets I spent a lot of time next building data sets, here , and , and building basic quick and dirty LSTM tensor flow models. And also . I also tried different approaches for understanding the models I was building. Including looking at raw logits, as per the below graphic, from my 2019-07-13-Four notebook. I thought this was a cool method compared to a confusion matrix for instance is because it shows the raw logits of each of the four classes, before the argmax voting observed in a confusion matrix is done.\nScaling I took a deeper histogram look at my data, seeing quite a lot of ups and downs.\n(Given that there were some crazy jumps, I thought I needed to do something about that) And so on 2019-12-21 , I ended up trying out more scaling approaches, especially MinMaxScaler. I had 8 features I was focusing on at that point and I plotted how my minMaxScaler min and max parameters changed as I processed roughly 40 or so mini datasets I had in my h5 training file data/2019-12-21T215926Z/train.h5. Re-posting my image :\nLuckily I found I was able to use just a single sklearn MinMaxScaler object to capture all 8 features at once. I then applied the scalers to transform my train.h5 data to a train_scaled.h5 dataset. And I also ended up with a balanced dataset , train_balanced.h5, that I could use for training.\nI trained a model and plotted training and validation loss curves the next day .\nAnd wow the validation loss ( link ) looked intense ,\nAs a side note. although the validation loss here looks totally skewed towards class 1 , I want to step back and note I really appreciate the technique of actually creating the \u0026ldquo;balanced\u0026rdquo; test set I referred to above. That allows us to quickly knows the model is favoring one class over another in the first place. And also I really dig the technique of simply snapshotting the tensorflow models while training and then being able to know how the validation logloss looks across those training batches. I feel like combining these techniques was really helpful in digesting what is going on . I needed to enjoy little details like that amidst all of the trial and error that was happening here (Emphasis on the error part haha).\nShuffling and adjusting dropout At a later date , I adjusted my lstm dropout from 0.2 to 0.7 , seeing quite different behavior in the validation loss. I had also added some shuffling code taking my 'history/2019-12-22T174803Z/train_balanced.h5' dataset to produce 'history/2019-12-22T174803Z/train_scaled_balanced_shuffled.h5' , to possibly change some of the choppiness of the validation curve seen above ^^ . That produced a validation loss , reposting the image here,\nMore epochs? On 2018-12-28 I got curious about whether just throwing more data at this problem would help. So I extended my waiting time by two and let the training happen in two epochs . The validation loss from here , (reposting\u0026hellip;) however showed that throwing more data is not always the answer. It always depends haha.\nWeight initialization Per my notebook entry I had read per this article that the default tensor flow weight initialization I had been using was GlorotUniform , ( which is aka Xavier Uniform apparently ) . I realized it was at least worth considering weight initialization as another hyper parameter so here I tried the Glorot or Xavier Normal instead . The validation loss did not necessarily convey the difference however:\nAt this point I think I was realizing that the order of ideas to try matters. And you do not know in advance what is the best order. Perhaps the weight initialization matters a good deal, but I had not yet found the critical next step yet at that point.\nClass balance In my next notebook I wanted to understand why my class 1 kept getting favored. I tried out forcing the weights of my training data to basically\n{0: 1., 1: 0., 2: 0., 3: 0.} to see what happens and sure enough, per the validation loss , the loss now went down only for class 0. So the effect was controlled.\nActive Learning: changing the training approach Somehow I came upon the idea of preferentially training on what your model is doing poorly on. So on 2020-01-19 I modified my training loop so that I dynamically adjusted my training weights according to which class was being misclassified. The effect on the training loss was really interesting. Everything was way smoother.\nLooking at a training loss plot from earlier ( such as from 2019-12-28 )\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/namoopsoo/aviation-pilot-physiology-hmm/master/notes/2020-01-19--update_files/2020-01-19--update_10_0.png\nThe validation loss was still favoring that one class, but I decided to hold on to this technique and keep trying other things.\nFull training set error Next in this notebook I wanted to better answer whether my particular test set perhaps had some very different size data compared to my training set, which was blowing up my test set error. I did not have enough data to better split apart my data at the moment actually, but instead I took a quick detour to compare my training mini batch loss curves to the full training set losses, during training. Naturally one would expect that if batch training losses improve that overall training set loss should also improve. Per the below diagram from my notebook, that was indeed the case.\nShuffling train/test After having consistently weird results with validation error, I decided to try re-building my train/test sets by doing a full random shuffle instead, in my 2020-02-01 notebook. Up until this point I had been using the fact that the data is divided into crew1, crew2, crew3, etc and I have used crew1 for train and crew2 for test. And I had built scalers from my crew1 training data, applying them to the the crew2 test data.\nSo this time around I instead built scalers from crew1 and then changed my function, build_many_scalers_from_h5 to take scalers as a parameter and I kept updating them with the test data. ( My scalers 'history/2020-02-02T044441Z/scalers.joblib' was the restulting artifact).\nIn validation , I think for the first time, I saw the validation error actually start going down ,\nI took that further in this 2020-02-08 notebook and ( showing my figure again ) going 3 epochs instead, I got ..\nSo the bright side I take from this is that the validation loss is actually doing better for three out of four of the classes.\nReconsider that high dropout Next in 2020-02-15 notebook, I decided to reduce my dropout slightly, after reading through this post about treating the dropout as yet another hyperparameter. After retraining , across 2 epochs, I saw a validation loss curve, which looked better still.\nThis indicates perhaps the context of hyperparameters being experimented with indeed matters . I think Andrew Ng\u0026rsquo;s characterization of \u0026ldquo;model babysitting\u0026rdquo;.\nhttps://github.com/namoopsoo/aviation-pilot-physiology-hmm/blob/master/notes/2020-02-15.md\nPrediction Speedup At this point I had improved my validation results enough that I wanted to submit my predictions. But as I described in my notebook , the 17.9 million test examples would take potentially 25 hours per my back of the envelope calculation.\nBut luckily I discovered that just playing with my prediction batch size, changing it from 32 to 1024, I found I could cut my time from 56k examples/292 seconds to 56k examples/27s , taking the back of the envelope calculation from 25 hours to 2.5 hours !..\nI also ended up utilizing awk to actually build batches for predict, avoiding trying to squeeze everything into memory.\nAnd for one final optimization, I added multi-processing with joblib , to take advantage of all of my available cores.\nThe steps get more detailed in this notebook.\n","permalink":"https://michal.piekarczyk.xyz/project/2020-04-05-aviation-kaggle-low-level/","summary":"learning physiological state from time series data","title":"Physiological deep learnings"},{"content":"Here I\u0026rsquo;m doing one of the Keras hello world micro projects, involving classification of tiny 28x28 wardrobe images.

What This is a simple time tracker lambda and DynamoDB based service, built as a project to learn clojure and micro services. The initial inspiration came from reading the book 168 Hours, in which Laura Vanderkam asks us to really see what we are doing with our time. There are 168 hours in a week and her claim is that although we feel we never have enough time, journaling what we do is a means to bullshit test ourselves.\nInput data We split our time between personal and work universes. (Actually this project doesnt care how you divide your life, but the first term, below, is a \u0026ldquo;core-category\u0026rdquo; ) \u0026hellip; And furthermore we bring our attention to either specific Projects, which have a beginning and an end, such as the below taxes-2017\u0026ndash;hopefully one day I will finish my taxes\u0026ndash;and adhoc tasks which is meant to record time spent helping a colleague for example (here called consulting, below). routine is a potentially useful \u0026ndash;or not\u0026ndash; distinction of things we do which do not have an End. times 2018-02-10 10:00 - 10:30 ; personal ; taxes-2017 ; plan ; just starting out 10:30 - 11:05 ; personal ; routine ; yoga 11:35 - 12:20 ; work ; WRK-345-bugfix-foo ; code 12:20 - 13:05 ; work ; adhoc ; consulting 13:05 - 13:35 ; work ; WRK-345-bugfix-foo ; code Output example Here is an example of an output stacked area chart of a core-category:work query, which is using the author\u0026rsquo;s data from December of 2017. This uses the d3js so called stacked layout. The y-axis represents minutes. This chart is not labeled, but it is possible to see that some days in the week of December 4th had multiple competing interests, while the week of Dec 11th there was a bit more focus on the Purple project. This particular layout only allows for a max of 20 layers before colors are re-used for other categories. a lot can be said about stacked area chart aesthetics.

Just out of curiosity, as a first mini starter project I decided to look at the relationship between rider age and speed I realized pretty early that the bike station target was too small, so I started using the Google Geolocation API to get broader location data such as zip codes and neighborhoods . geolocation I also thought on a high level that knowing whether you got on your bike at 4:05 in the afternoon versus 4:06 shouldn\u0026rsquo;t influence my learning algorithm, so I added some more transformations. I compared the prediction accuracy of the new geolocation data as a first stab I ran through a couple of modeling scenarios here and finding some impoartant inconsistencies in how I was running my testing I ended up getting some good gains by binarizing my inputs I ended up using a different evaluation metric again to get a different perspective on this problem. Maybe a year or more later I came back to this problem from the point of view of experimenting with AWS approaches to training models , including Docker and SageMaker. Thoughts for future improvements More on this data When I started looking at this data, there were 400+ stations for docking your citibike. There is age, and some of the riders were actually born in the 1800s, which is kind of cool. df = load_data(\u0026#39;data/201509_10-citibike-tripdata.csv.annotated.100000.06112016T1814.csv\u0026#39;) In [6]: df[\u0026#39;birth year\u0026#39;].describe() Out[6]: count 83171.000000 mean 1977.149680 std 11.400096 min 1885.000000 25% 1969.000000 50% 1980.000000 75% 1986.000000 max 1999.000000 Name: birth year, dtype: float64 Speed and Age Turns out that you need to know the miles per the longitude degree at a particular latitude on our planet. So for our particular location, at lat around 40.723 and using the earth\u0026rsquo;s radius of about 3958 miles , we have about 52.3 miles/longitude degree here in NYC.\nSo from there, looking at some of the speed data just involved looking at the tripdata trip time and calculating the cartesian distance.\n(More on the code here ) (Also more detail on this analysis in the main jupyter notebook)\nNeed additional location data With the 400+ stations, trying to predict a multi-class problem of this sort with basic machine learning algorithms would not be a way to get quick results to help keep the project going, so I decided to constrain the problem. I ended up turning to the Google Geocoding API. Using this data became its own side project, because parsing through the Google geolocation data can get pretty hairy! The meat of the output can look like this, for the docking station \u0026ldquo;1st Avenue \u0026amp; E 15th St\u0026rdquo;\n{ \u0026#39;raw_result\u0026#39;: [{u\u0026#39;address_components\u0026#39;: [{u\u0026#39;long_name\u0026#39;: u\u0026#39;1st Avenue\u0026#39;, u\u0026#39;short_name\u0026#39;: u\u0026#39;1st Avenue\u0026#39;, u\u0026#39;types\u0026#39;: [u\u0026#39;route\u0026#39;]}, {u\u0026#39;long_name\u0026#39;: u\u0026#39;Midtown\u0026#39;, u\u0026#39;short_name\u0026#39;: u\u0026#39;Midtown\u0026#39;, u\u0026#39;types\u0026#39;: [u\u0026#39;neighborhood\u0026#39;, u\u0026#39;political\u0026#39;]}, {u\u0026#39;long_name\u0026#39;: u\u0026#39;Manhattan\u0026#39;, u\u0026#39;short_name\u0026#39;: u\u0026#39;Manhattan\u0026#39;, u\u0026#39;types\u0026#39;: [u\u0026#39;sublocality_level_1\u0026#39;, u\u0026#39;sublocality\u0026#39;, u\u0026#39;political\u0026#39;]}, {u\u0026#39;long_name\u0026#39;: u\u0026#39;New York\u0026#39;, u\u0026#39;short_name\u0026#39;: u\u0026#39;New York\u0026#39;, u\u0026#39;types\u0026#39;: [u\u0026#39;locality\u0026#39;, u\u0026#39;political\u0026#39;]}, {u\u0026#39;long_name\u0026#39;: u\u0026#39;New York County\u0026#39;, u\u0026#39;short_name\u0026#39;: u\u0026#39;New York County\u0026#39;, u\u0026#39;types\u0026#39;: [u\u0026#39;administrative_area_level_2\u0026#39;, u\u0026#39;political\u0026#39;]}, {u\u0026#39;long_name\u0026#39;: u\u0026#39;New York\u0026#39;, u\u0026#39;short_name\u0026#39;: u\u0026#39;NY\u0026#39;, u\u0026#39;types\u0026#39;: [u\u0026#39;administrative_area_level_1\u0026#39;, u\u0026#39;political\u0026#39;]}, {u\u0026#39;long_name\u0026#39;: u\u0026#39;United States\u0026#39;, u\u0026#39;short_name\u0026#39;: u\u0026#39;US\u0026#39;, u\u0026#39;types\u0026#39;: [u\u0026#39;country\u0026#39;, u\u0026#39;political\u0026#39;]}, {u\u0026#39;long_name\u0026#39;: u\u0026#39;10003\u0026#39;, u\u0026#39;short_name\u0026#39;: u\u0026#39;10003\u0026#39;, u\u0026#39;types\u0026#39;: [u\u0026#39;postal_code\u0026#39;]}], u\u0026#39;formatted_address\u0026#39;: u\u0026#39;1st Avenue \u0026amp; E 15th St, New York, NY 10003, USA\u0026#39;, } Some of the challenges here were that the outputs from the API were not always consistent. The above output shows that the\n'neighborhood' is 'Midtown', but because there were 400+ stations, I did not initially notice that sometimes the neighborhood was missing or that the zip code was missing. That ended up throwing off my code a couple of times. It turned out that the street intersection was not an ideal clean data input to the API. For instance E 3 St \u0026amp; 1 Ave, NY was understood by the API as just a street or a route as it is called, ( raw output ). Later on I ended up refactoring this to use the raw latitude and longitude . However, I eventually noticed that often times the docking stations were on the edge of neighborhoods. So I literally had edge cases! The Neighborhood would come back blank and I ended up having to fill in a lot of that data by hand anyhow! Also the data calls were not free and I ended up building a small caching layer with redis . The other reason I had done that was that I would often work out of cafes where the Wifi was spotty and I didn\u0026rsquo;t want an internet connection to hold me back. I think in hind-sight, I could have avoided some of the automation here and just decoupled the data fetch so that I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about that internet connection. Of course every time I wanted to add additional data from Citibike, there would be new docking stations and I had to get back to making sure my station location data was correct, so that bad data did not impact predictions. Time bucketing In order to get better information from the source time, the source time was bucketted into 24 hour-buckets per day. That is since a ride starting at 1:04:23pm shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be treated as being too different from a ride departing at 1:05:24pm . There is more value in intuitively clustering the rides.\nComparing Geolocation Granularities There are about 463 stations found in the dataset, 28 neighborhoods, representing 49 postal codes and 3 out of 5 boroughs,\nSo using the (start time bucket, start station id, age, gender) as the inputs and with RandomizedLogisticRegression as a classifier , for about a months worth of trip data, I saw roughly the following comparison.\n{\u0026#39;end station id\u0026#39;: OrderedDict([(\u0026#39;training\u0026#39;, OrderedDict([(\u0026#39;accuracy_score\u0026#39;, 0.041432771986099973), (\u0026#39;f1_score\u0026#39;, 0.015138704086611844), (\u0026#39;recall_score\u0026#39;, 0.041432771986099973), (\u0026#39;precision_score\u0026#39;, 0.016942125433308568)])), (\u0026#39;holdout\u0026#39;, OrderedDict([(\u0026#39;accuracy_score\u0026#39;, 0.031533939070016032), (\u0026#39;f1_score\u0026#39;, 0.0093952628045424723), (\u0026#39;recall_score\u0026#39;, 0.031533939070016032), (\u0026#39;precision_score\u0026#39;, 0.0067157290264759353)]))]), \u0026#39;end_neighborhood\u0026#39;: OrderedDict([(\u0026#39;training\u0026#39;, OrderedDict([(\u0026#39;accuracy_score\u0026#39;, 0.39047231270358307), (\u0026#39;f1_score\u0026#39;, 0.28885663229134789), (\u0026#39;recall_score\u0026#39;, 0.39047231270358307), (\u0026#39;precision_score\u0026#39;, 0.26445041603375502)])), (\u0026#39;holdout\u0026#39;, OrderedDict([(\u0026#39;accuracy_score\u0026#39;, 0.39630836047774159), (\u0026#39;f1_score\u0026#39;, 0.2935527390151364), (\u0026#39;recall_score\u0026#39;, 0.39630836047774159), (\u0026#39;precision_score\u0026#39;, 0.26579390443173939)]))]), \u0026#39;end_postal_code\u0026#39;: OrderedDict([(\u0026#39;training\u0026#39;, OrderedDict([(\u0026#39;accuracy_score\u0026#39;, 0.14129127122042506), (\u0026#39;f1_score\u0026#39;, 0.068340173428106887), (\u0026#39;recall_score\u0026#39;, 0.14129127122042506), (\u0026#39;precision_score\u0026#39;, 0.068168259430770747)])), (\u0026#39;holdout\u0026#39;, OrderedDict([(\u0026#39;accuracy_score\u0026#39;, 0.13361838588989844), (\u0026#39;f1_score\u0026#39;, 0.064738931917963718), (\u0026#39;recall_score\u0026#39;, 0.13361838588989844), (\u0026#39;precision_score\u0026#39;, 0.067139580345228156)]))]), \u0026#39;end_sublocality\u0026#39;: OrderedDict([(\u0026#39;training\u0026#39;, OrderedDict([(\u0026#39;accuracy_score\u0026#39;, 0.95354786589470852), (\u0026#39;f1_score\u0026#39;, 0.95209028150037733), (\u0026#39;recall_score\u0026#39;, 0.95354786589470852), (\u0026#39;precision_score\u0026#39;, 0.95217920885515972)])), (\u0026#39;holdout\u0026#39;, OrderedDict([(\u0026#39;accuracy_score\u0026#39;, 0.9493807215939688), (\u0026#39;f1_score\u0026#39;, 0.94990282092170586), (\u0026#39;recall_score\u0026#39;, 0.9493807215939688), (\u0026#39;precision_score\u0026#39;, 0.95132373575480056)]))])} The rough accuracies for prediction, end station id (~3%), postal code (~13%), neighborhood (~40%), and borough (~95%), using the small dataset, shows the rough differences in what happens when you reduce the number of possible outputs. Overall this gave me the motivation to focus on the neighborhood as a target to try to improve upon. More in the jupyter notebook Deeper into the weeds I compared the SGDClassifier with the LogisticRegression classifier (which I believe just uses Gradient Descent, while the SGDClassifier classifier is also a Logistic Regression classifier, but it uses Stochastic Gradient Descent).\nI also tried applying Standard Scaling to my input data after reading that scikit learn \u0026rsquo;s SGDClassifier implementation is sensitive unless the input data has a mean=0 and variance=1 . Indeed per the below this helped a little.\nI also applied a GridSearch around the alpha parameter to the SGDClassifier, but this did not help at least the way I tried it,\nI next started varying the training set size, given that a month worth of trip data had about a million rows, I went from 10k to 1M,\nBut this didn\u0026rsquo;t look great. I realized a problem I had was that I was not randomly sampling my input data. Since a month-size dataset is around 1.2 Million rows, then a 10,000 large set just ends up barely dipping into the first day. So choosing the dataset sizes has to be done, by random sampling.\nAfter making the sampling randomized, the output below, feels like it has a better upward trend, but it is still not visible enough.\nI also realized I was being inconsistent in my assessment because I was not using a single holdout set to test. I was actually randomly generating a test set each time. That was really bad. So I created ten models on sizes 10,000 through 100,000 datasets, created from 09 and 10 2015, and testing on a single holdout dataset, taken from November 2015. In this approach, the accuracy results are found using the same holdout set instead of using a differently derived test set each time.\nAlthough the results were still pretty flat, at least I can trust the consistency of my test method more now.\nMore in the jupyter notebook\nBinarizing the inputs Another important modeling change to try was to do a better of job of preparing the input data to better expose the stratification across citibike trips across the sources. To do this, instead of using a source station column and source neighborhood columns, the source neighborhood column was binarized using the sklearn OneHotEncoder, to a column for each of the neighborhoods in the surface area of the city. The same experiment as earlier was conducted, comparing results across the default SGDClassifier and LogisticRegression classifiers and also across 100,000 to 1,000,000 size datasets used for a train/test split along with a 100,000 large holdout set. These were created from just the single 2015-09 dataset (201509-citibike-tripdata.csv). I found this to be very helpful. Here\u0026rsquo;s a summary graphic, More details in the notebook\nChanging my metric one more time Given that there are about 28 neighborhoods covered by Citibike (at least in the data end of 2015), a high accuracy is difficult to achieve especially because there are many output classes to choose from. Another idea that was explored was to create a Rank K Accuracy, such that a prediction is correct when the correct class is found in the top highest K probabilities. The overall reasoning I had here is two-fold. One, I think of the analogy of a search engine, where it is typically acceptable to show someone five results as opposed to the so called \u0026ldquo;I am feeling lucky\u0026rdquo; result. Of course not every machine learning use case will have the tolerance to take five results as opposed to five, but I think my particular problem of choice it might be fine. Or at least asking people would help to answer that question.\nBut I think the main reason I wanted to do this was to just better understand whether my classification approach was doing anything at all. So since, out of these 28 or so neighborhoods, if going from the top 1 result to the top 2 results, yields an additional 20 points of accuracy, then I feel a little better about the result making sense.\nMore detail in the notebook\nSageMaker approach I wanted to test drive AWS SageMaker ,\nTo see if I could more easily train models without relying on my laptop And make my training environment more reproducible And the prospect of hyper parameter tuning jobs seemed pretty neat too And I wanated to see just how simple serving models would be And in general I wanted to do all of these things to see if I could end up using this at my job (which I did). What ended up happening I managed to recreate my basic model training and evaluation setup using Docker and Sagemaker. With SageMaker, Docker, your model is more compartmentalized and I found this was helpful when iterating model code and boiler plate code. I also ended up serving the model on an endpoint. This is still a sort of a back burner project I would like to come back to at some point, but below I show one update I made to have a slightly better time debugging changes my model iterations And I go over several more data roadblocks I ran into. Changes to Model Iterations To make things slightly easier to understand, especially for debugging purposes, I now made models into json objects that are easier to display\nlocalfn =

a data input for predictions and also requiring the Docker image implement a train command for running training jobs. I ended up adding a setup.py to my git repo to version what code a particular Dockerfile would use I made many iterations in trying to get the model on SageMaker up and running, so I liked the experience overall. Bad data strikes again After quickly updating docking station data and retraining, I ended up with a model which was returning only one value as an output I took a deeper dive into my docking station data and found yet again that I had a lot of blank geolocation neighborhood and postal code data. This is the same problem I had to deal with in the past as well. I ended up finding while debugging, that the empty data was essentially pinning the majority of the training data as neighborhood : 'nan', and so the predictions, per this confusion matrix, were basically all the same output. ipdb\u0026gt; pp skm.confusion_matrix(y_validation, y_predictions, classes) array([[ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 174], [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 116], [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 130], [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 357], [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 364], [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 255], [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 862], [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 97977]]) ipdb\u0026gt; Of course one data problem always leads to another data problem. This time around, when I started updating my docking station geolocation data, I found that my payment information may have changed and so I was getting the following ipdb\u0026gt; pp geocoding_result {u\u0026#39;error_message\u0026#39;: u\u0026#39;You have exceeded your daily request quota for this API. If you did not set a custom daily request quota, verify your project has an active billing account: http://g.co/dev/maps-no-account\u0026#39;, u\u0026#39;results\u0026#39;: [], u\u0026#39;status\u0026#39;: u\u0026#39;OVER_QUERY_LIMIT\u0026#39;} And of course I also ended up stepping on my own foot as well. I found I had created an unfortinate git commit where I accidentally undid the url-encoding and intersections with \u0026amp; are I think treated as query string parameters , , which ended up being a reason why some of my data was coming back as just the geolocation for a single street (route) and not an actual intersection. Future Improvements I am hoping to come back to this and continue to iterate the approach. In particular, I would like to continue to explore model degradation over time. And in discussing with a few colleagues, seasonality would also be a really good feature to consider. Time bucketing was explored to a limited extent, but the day of the week nor the month of the year was not explored. There may also be many other datasets which can be joined with this one to bolster the information available, including information about the weather or perhaps other demographic attributes available. A more thorough comparison of algorithms should also be considered.

The first example was initially unintuitive, because I was trying to concat the output of a map, (def full-list (concat (map (fn [x] (blah x)) input-vector))) that was not working, and so i needed to update w/ an apply, (def full-list (apply concat (map (fn [x] (blah x)) input-vector))) Similarly to concat, conj can be used with apply in the same way\u0026hellip; app.core=\u0026gt; (def vec [0 1 2 3 4]) #\u0026#39;app.core/vec app.core=\u0026gt; (apply conj vec [99 88]) [0 1 2 3 4 99 88] So to explain the above, the normal form for conj is actually (conj vec 99 88), but if we have those args as a vector [99 88] then we can use apply to make the args vector be presented to conj as args. doseq and for from \u0026hellip; https://stackoverflow.com/a/4725502/472876 The difference is that for builds a lazy sequence and returns it while doseq is for executing side-effects and returns nil. user=\u0026gt; (for [x [1 2 3]] (+ x 5)) (6 7 8) user=\u0026gt; (doseq [x [1 2 3]] (+ x 5)) nil user=\u0026gt; (doseq [x [1 2 3]] (println x)) 1 2 3 nil If you want to build a new sequence based on other sequences, use for. If you want to do side-effects (printing, writing to a database, launching a nuclear warhead, etc) based on elements from some sequences, use doseq.

At one point when migrating databricks notebooks to be useable purely with dbutils.notebook.run, the question came up, hey dbutils.notebook.run is a great way of calling notebooks explicitly, avoiding global variables that make code difficult to lint and debug, but what about spark dataframes?\nI had come across this https://docs.databricks.com/notebooks/notebook-workflows.html#pass-structured-data nice bit of documentation about using the spark global temp view to handle name references to nicely shuttle around dataframes by reference, given that a caller notebook and a callee notebook share a JVM and theoretically this is instantaneous.\nHowever the example code was a bit lacking and I ended up writing some nice helper functions to make the passing of dataframes, alongside other parameters, a little bit easier and more intuitive!\nOne of the issues I had with the toy example was that it used static names to pass dataframes, like my_data. This was clearly just an example, but I wanted a higher gurantee in avoiding weird collisions, so I used uuid to help randomize the names.\nBut also I wanted to be able to nicely debug my new view names, so I wanted to mix the random uuid names with informative names too. It is not straightforward to programmatically capture the name of a variable as a string (you can go down a rabbit hole trying to figure this out haha) so I just settled on creating a simple function prepare_arguments which takes keyword arguments and uses them as the string names of dataframes, when creating random temp view names.\nI also wanted the flexibility of just mixing and matching the plain parmeters you pass in, along with dataframes, without making a big deal about it.\nHere is where I ended up below :)\nimport json import pandas as pd from uuid import uuid4 from pyspark.sql import SparkSession def prepare_arguments(**kwargs): \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;Create the dbutils.notebook.run payload and put dataframes into global_temp.\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; input_dataframes = {k: v for (k, v) in kwargs.items() if isinstance(v, pd.DataFrame)} the_rest = {k: v for (k, v) in kwargs.items() if k not in input_dataframes} dataframes_dict = prepare_dataframe_references(**input_dataframes) return {**the_rest, \u0026#34;input_dataframes\u0026#34;: json.dumps(dataframes_dict)} def handle_output(raw_output): output = json.loads(raw_output) dataframes_dict = output.pop(\u0026#34;output_dataframe_references\u0026#34;, {}) output_dataframes = dereference_dataframes(dataframes_dict) the_rest = {k: v for (k, v) in output.items() if k not in output_dataframes} return {**output_dataframes, **the_rest} def dereference_dataframes(dataframes_dict): spark = SparkSession.builder.appName(\u0026#34;project\u0026#34;).getOrCreate() return { name: spark.table(\u0026#34;global_temp.\u0026#34; + view_name) for (name, view_name) in dataframes_dict.items() } def prepare_dataframe_references(**kwargs): \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;Puts dataframes into the global_temp schema and returns the view names.

And in testing whether my non-null value was first or last made a big difference! round does not work on double precision Wow interesting. I was comparing features generated in two tables to do some QA. Table 1 was the original or \u0026ldquo;target gold\u0026rdquo; table and table 2 was a table generated by production code. Using a simple table1.col1 = table2.col1 comparison, a particular float column was coming back as 0.092 , for about 100k rows. Hand inspecting, this looked like a difference of precision, but when I applied round(table1.col1, 3) = round(table2.col1, 3) instead, I got UndefinedFunction: function round(double precision, integer) does not exist And surely enough after reading the docs , oddly enough round with precision is only defined for numeric and not float8 (aka double precision). After casting to numeric my result of round(table1.col1::numeric, 3) = round(table2.col1::numeric, 3) was 0.990.

Scanning a large table to verify a new foreign key or check constraint can take a long time, and other updates to the table are locked out until the ALTER TABLE ADD CONSTRAINT command is committed. The main purpose of the NOT VALID constraint option is to reduce the impact of adding a constraint on concurrent updates. With NOT VALID, the ADD CONSTRAINT command does not scan the table and can be committed immediately. After that, a VALIDATE CONSTRAINT command can be issued to verify that existing rows satisfy the constraint. The validation step does not need to lock out concurrent updates, since it knows that other transactions will be enforcing the constraint for rows that they insert or update; only pre-existing rows need to be checked. Hence, validation acquires only a SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE lock on the table being altered. (If the constraint is a foreign key then a ROW SHARE lock is also required on the table referenced by the constraint.) In addition to improving concurrency, it can be useful to use NOT VALID and VALIDATE CONSTRAINT in cases where the table is known to contain pre-existing violations. Once the constraint is in place, no new violations can be inserted, and the existing problems can be corrected at leisure until VALIDATE CONSTRAINT finally succeeds.\n-- step one. alter table the_table_name ADD constraint the_constraint_name unique (col1, col2) NOT VALID -- step two.. alter table the_table_name VALIDATE CONSTRAINT the_constraint_name Having Interesting conditional syntax aroung group by , without using a CTE\u0026hellip; select id, key , count(*) countt from my_table group by id, key having count(*) \u0026gt; 1 =\u0026gt; id key countt 1 foo 2 2 bar 3 invalid input syntax for integer Having come across this a few times, writing down here.. InvalidTextRepresentation: invalid input syntax for integer: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; This typically means a blank string is being coaxed as an integer somewhere. The solution is basically to find these and make sure they\u0026rsquo;re nulls on the db. And can also partition with an id column too for example, to do a little at a time to experiment. update mytable set blahcol = null where blahcol = \u0026#39;\u0026#39; and ( id between 1 and 100000) A warning about CTEs Per this article , postgresql will run full CTE and store it, which is why I feel the only practical way of using CTEs in large expressions is along with partitioning . In other words, although most postgresql queries will be able to run only the first 200 rows like a \u0026ldquo;generator\u0026rdquo; and return that to you really quickly, when you have a CTE in there, it has to run the whole thing first.

(2020-08-23 to 2020-12-12)\nThe Book in Three Sentences Meritocracy replaced direct inheritance style aristocracy after the post World War II baby boomers overwhelmed colleges\u0026ndash;forcing them to create the SAT to deal with admissions\u0026ndash;and has been snowballing a self reinforcing selection process that has been undoing the middle class ever since. The elite make bank slogging gnarly hours more than by stereotypical capital gains loop holes and \u0026ldquo;the rest\u0026rdquo; work fewer hours, involuntarily left out of the economy. The contribution of the elite is more self serving and the States would benefit from unraveling and debunking the idea that the elite are \u0026ldquo;adding incremental value\u0026rdquo;.\nImpressions I better understand why America is suffering right now and why the so called \u0026ldquo;elite\u0026rdquo; class is being asked to take responsibility. Mid level jobs have been getting displaced for decades now. The author points to examples in law, finance, medicine and technology. \u0026ldquo;Elites\u0026rdquo; can \u0026ldquo;invest\u0026rdquo; their money in their kids education \u0026ldquo;tax free\u0026rdquo; (the author points out this is a tax loop hole that lets the wealthy bypass estate taxes) and the roughly $130,000 cap on payroll taxes (paid by employers) incentivizes employers to hire fewer highly skilled individuals as opposed to a larger number of mid skilled individuals. And the author argues that removing this $130,000 cap would help reverse this perverse incentive and include more folks in the economy.\nI did not realize that only 25% of people in the US go to college.\nWhy the benefits of the elite are over-sold The author raises the point that the elite are not adding \u0026ldquo;incremental value\u0026rdquo;, where they not present at a particular company, with some re-arranging, the output of that company would be comparable.\n\u0026ldquo;Today, the meritocratic elite, not individually but as a class, is in precisely this position. Superordinate labor is essential to production given the current state of technology, which causes the labor market to fetishize elite skills. This entails that total output is much greater when elites work than when the remaining less skilled workers attempt to deploy current technologies without the elite.\u0026rdquo;\nThe argument is that The elite add value on paper but without them society if given the chance can potentially reorganize and still achieve an optimal outcome . This makes sense to me on many levels most in the ranking algorithms used to predict for merit including the SAT. They can and are gamed by \u0026ldquo;teaching to the test\u0026rdquo;. If you have the resources you will get the best mark but theres no reason to believe this has transfer to the real world. So if the metric is flawed to begin with the the whole promise is flawed. The same happens in the work place all the time. Doctors have had very little training in nutrition which turns out today to be the reason Diabetes and heart disease are leading deaths in the US. Even in my field Data Science theres a large stigma against non phd folks. But having a phd you don\u0026rsquo;t solve real world problems. Real world data is messy. Which is why like the author would agree i think on the job training is invaluable.\n\u0026ldquo;And the elite executives who have monopolized the management function congratulate themselves on their vast and productive powers of command and again expect to be paid commensurately. Superordinate workers of all stripes therefore insist that the inequality that their wages produce is meritocratic.\u0026rdquo;\nYes. Management takes the prize for the biggest false value add that has still not been noticed. In technical fields, in software, top down waterfall design h, today masquerading as \u0026ldquo;agile development\u0026rdquo;, wastes more time than saves, somehow appears to add value but we would all be much better off without it.\n\u0026ldquo;The precise balance between gain and loss of course remains speculative. But the best evidence suggests that the elite’s true product may be near zero.\u0026rdquo;\nI think the better yardstick of success should be general well being in your country. Like how good is the median income? And America fails in health, wealth, education inequality and all other objective measures. It just perpetuates and justifies itself through its own made up metrics that are disconnected from reality. And it creates perverse incentives. Doctors treat wealthier patients because they can help them pay off their crazy student debt and they are penalized for trying to treat medicare patients with less money and less time to spend with patients. Similarly Apple watch now has an EKG cool but that benefits those who can afford it. Maybe only Google can be congratulated for democratizing information. Facebook is a gateway to rent seekers buying your data for selling you junk you don\u0026rsquo;t need or political shenanigans to swing your vote.\n\u0026ldquo;Like the warriors, the elite’s true product must be offset by the costs of meritocratic inequality, and especially by meritocracy’s suppression (through inducing innovation that fetishizes skill) of mid-skilled, middle-class production.\u0026rdquo;\nYes this is the cost that society is burdened with. Financial crises adding instability to peoples Retirements. Or elite companies like amazon concentrating wealth for themselves while redirecting people to purchase not US based US made services and products. Or Elite lawyers/ lobbyists crafting laws that only benefit their constituents on paper but really serve corporations or simply gerrymandering to disenfranchise voters. Or elite insurance company executives figuring out how to line their own pockets without actually providing care to those who need it if it affects their bottom line. Or the elite at facebook who have allowed the likes of Cambridge Analytica to influence our elections.\nSome of my other thoughts I was hoping to learn more about the day in the life of these highly paid lawyers and bankers I work in technology and even after reading this book I cannot yet visualize what does the 100 hour work week of a lawyer or banker look like. Personally I think most people over estimate the usefulness of the time they spend (evidence goes to all the books being written on the topic of distraction lately such as Indistractable ). I can do my best to achieve six to eight low distraction hours on a good day, with an additional two or three more hours coming in as pure administrative overhead or communication cost. But on most days, collaboration cost is much higher and I will spend my time helping other people solve their problems. I wonder whether the these kinds of discounts also affect the legal and financial fields. I know I have read and listened to friends anecdotes that in health care the beautacratic overhead is a high discount on time, taking away from time otherwise spent performing \u0026ldquo;health care\u0026rdquo;.\nMore Quotes \u0026ldquo;A simple example illustrates the special burden that the payroll tax imposes specifically on middle-class labor. If a bank deploys midcentury financial technologies to issue home mortgages using twenty mid-skilled loan officers who each earn $100,000 per year, this costs the bank and the workers, taken together, $306,000 in payroll taxes. By contrast, if the bank were to switch to the current mode of production and displace the mid- skilled loan officers with a single Wall Street trader who earns $2 million, this would cost the bank and the trader only about $90,000. Where two technologies of production are economically equivalent, but one requires twenty mid-skilled workers while the other requires one super-skilled worker,\u0026rdquo;\nNice example but i feel like id like to understand what that one person is doing thats letting them do the work of twenty. Unless theyre writing software to automate the work i dont get it. oh unless were just talking about Not doing the same work but just comparing two ways a bank can makd money. One way is by issuing mortgages and another is by investing.\n\u0026ldquo;Progressive reformers must take aim at each of the two mechanisms that produced meritocratic inequality.\u0026rdquo;\nTwo mechanisms? Let me guess . Education ( move training back to on the job and deemphasize this elite style education based on disconnected metrics like SAT LSAT MCAT etc). And two Parenting ( hmm well not sure how you can dismantle elite parenting) . Employers ( yea again training, you hire more loosely maybe by laws, and people will end up being great anyway because if given a chance most people will not squander). State Laws and or standards boards ( i feel like the bar to entry into fields like medicine and law have become too monetary. Licenses and exams cost thousands. Where is that money going. Make that free) . Free education ( but if you make it free , cut those loans , more people can participate ). management elite ( Management consulting finds itself as some magical experts but i am unclear whether they add value. But not sure what that has to do with helping inequality yet. ) investors ( almost forgot. Yea these power grabs of vulture capitalism and leveraged buyouts , don\u0026rsquo;t really help companies only some select few. Lets back away from that so called shareholder value myth).\n\u0026ldquo;Progressives cannot answer because they remain under meritocracy’s thumb. They are captives who embrace their captor, through a sort of ideological Stockholm syndrome. As a result, progressives exacerbate problems that they do not even see. When they focus on identity politics and poverty relief, progressives dismiss middle- class discontent as special pleading.\u0026rdquo;\nAlso universal basic income . With automation hanging over the heads of many, this is still better than a beauracratic system where everyone has to prove their poverty. No penalties. But yea coddling folks can be counterproductive. I like the laws Germany was passing for no elite daycare. I like universal pre-k. Nyc has something like this now. i think if we cant rely on government to help since it is too slow and also very non cooperative politicians these days. Instead maybe we need a social tax of sorts. Collectively stop Feeding the elite companies cash and make it easier for people to shop local. Cut them off embargo them. Cancel Christmas shopping. But short of purchases, Education needs a huge cost restructuring. Maybe that does need to be free. Online education has slowly gotten democratized.\n\u0026ldquo;This allowed unskilled workers, doing simple repetitive tasks coordinated by industrial engineers, to make goods whose production previously required the integrated efforts of a skilled artisan. Along the way, the innovations displaced older artisanal methods and the highly skilled workers who once deployed them.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd today similar shifts may happen in technical, legal fields, which have An artisan component. Example with web site development today wordpress is really high in rankings (technology automation of web Skills which are routine). Similarly data centers now automate away infrastructure which used to be done physically. Even devops is being automated with infrastructure As code\n\u0026ldquo;process called corporate “reengineering,” which aspired to “break an organization down into its components parts and then put some of them together again to create a new machine.” The remaining parts, left out of the new machine, typically consisted of middle managers.\u0026rdquo;\nWow is this where silos got created. People can design structures all they want but more and more i think imposed structure creates constraints/teams/silos that are hard to undo. Instead, interdisciplinary teams built around tackling specific problems would increase cross pollination and reduce communication coordination cost . Maybe the so called Connway silos can work sometimes but Im observing a lot of resistance at my company when teams have a hard time banding together on new problems they would have done better to just make new break out teams. Feels like Shape Up jason fried territory too\n\u0026ldquo;The match between elite education and finance was made. The sleepy, mid-skilled, middle-class model of the sector gave way to rapid growth, constant innovation, and a super-elite (immensely skilled and extravagantly paid) workforce.\u0026rdquo;\nFunny how the author i think shows the world has glossed over how these securitized mortgages and these over priced junk assets brought the lending economy to a halt in 2008. Somehow these elites get a free pass in finance? The collateralization of small risky business loans is already a new looming danger just a decade later. Will student loans crisis multiplied by a covid economy yield another pat on the back for clever finance\n\u0026ldquo;Overall, about a quarter of finance’s exceptional growth came immediately and directly from the inequality- driven rise in household credit, and in particular the explosion of residential mortgages—though consumer credit, including credit card debt, also contributed substantially to this facet of finance. A further half of finance’s growth came from economic inequality’s other side, through the increased output of the securities industry. The securities boom was overwhelmingly propelled by the growth of asset management services—with especially rapid growth in private equity firms, venture capital firms, and hedge funds—which by nature serve the wealthy\u0026rdquo;\nOk a convenient summary. 0.25 mortgages 0.25 credit cards and 0.5 to securitization and hedge funds.\n\u0026ldquo;A generation of newly minted PhDs in physics and engineering found themselves without academic jobs. The new supply of super-skilled workers went looking for demand. At first, energy and communications companies, including most notably Exxon and Bell Labs, absorbed the new super-skilled workforce. But by 1980, Wall Street recognized that physicists and engineers could profitably develop and deploy new financial technologies and came calling—often literally. A physicist who entered finance early and eventually became a managing director at Goldman Sachs\u0026rdquo;\nOh wow interesting story. Crazy that no one would have predicted studying nuclear physics and pivot to financial engineering haha.\n","permalink":"https://michal.piekarczyk.xyz/post/2020-12-12-meritocracytrap-book-summary/","summary":"Meritocracy Trap Summary I Read this after hearing an interview with Daniel Markovits initially.
