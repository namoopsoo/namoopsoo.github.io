<div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>I have been trying to solve the steak puzzle for several attempts now. That is, how do you cook a good cast iron to oven transfer? The problem so far has been that the recommended time for the oven for a 450 finish, in <a href="https://www.therisingspoon.com/2013/04/how-to-cook-perfect-steak-in-cast-iron.html?m=1">this article</a> , 4-5 minutes is the recommendation for a medium steak and 2-4 minutes for a rare.</p>
<p>Although I did not quite follow the 450, I used 400 F, I followed the temperature lore from <a href=https://www.foodandwine.com/how/grilling-mistakes-avoid-according-chefs>here</a> last night, using a meat thermometer instead of time, because I suspect oven temperatures in one oven is not the same as that of another. There are possibly incorrect temperature readings.</p>
<p>So with a temperature reading fluctuating between 110 and 100</p>
<img src=https://my-blog-content.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/2020-05-steak/2020-05-30+22.22.41-temp110.jpg width=50%>
<img src=https://my-blog-content.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/2020-05-steak/2020-05-30+22.27.51-temp101.jpg width=50%>
<p>with just 5 minutes after, just doing the stove top cast iron for now, here is what the inside looked like.</p>
<img src=https://my-blog-content.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/2020-05-steak/2020-05-30+22.43.33-precut.jpg width=50%>
<p>So I know doing these pre-cuts is sacrilegious, but I just wanted to see.</p>
<p>At this point, and oh I was trying this new Le Creuset grill pan that my partner in crime acquisitioned, I was just trying to see if the new grill pan can cook the steak to temperature without using the oven. I forgot to mention this steak was huge. It was like 2 to 3 inches in thickness mostly.</p>
<p>Anyway, the weird part next is that after several attempts in the oven at 400 F, after about 15 minutes in the oven, best reading I got was 128F,</p>
<img src=https://my-blog-content.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/2020-05-steak/2020-05-30+23.06.51-128.jpg width=50%>
<p>And oddly enough after even more time in the oven, my readings fell down back to 120 F.</p>
<img src=https://my-blog-content.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/2020-05-steak/2020-05-30+23.24.17-temp120.jpg width=50%>
<p>At this point we (I) just ate the steak. The steak at this point (now maybe 30 minutes in the oven?) was clearly well done.</p>
<img src=https://my-blog-content.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/2020-05-steak/2020-05-30+23.45.32.jpg width=50%>
<p>I guess I only took one photo because it was still tasty with a lot of Utah salt.</p>
<p>But nonetheless I am confused by the discrepancy of 130F being a temp according to that Food & Wine article as being a &ldquo;medium rare&rdquo; classification.</p>
<p>But bone-the-less, at this point I suspect either the thermometer is faulty after being exposed to super high heat the other day (300+ even though it is only rated to 220) or the steak actually cools extremely fast after I take it out of the oven to do the measurement? Anyway my partner in crime here suggested I make a pie for which the temp for me at least consistently reads 170 for done-ness and in comparing the thermometer outcome in a known scenario I will take the excuse to make a pie thank you!</p>
