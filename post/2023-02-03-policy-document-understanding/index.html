recently at my company and here are some of my perspectives from the experience.</p><h3 id=plan-of-action>Plan of action</h3><p>So We settled to constrain our problem space to apply langchain, a library that wraps around large language model APIs notably the OpenAI API, to show language understanding from a publicly available health insurance plan summary of benefits document. We ended up starting out with this public facing document, which one can seee a description of <a href=https://www.medicareadvantage.com/plans/humana-community-hmo-h1036-236-000>here</a> with its download link <a href=here>https://content.sunfirematrix.com/2023/Humana-H1036-236-000-SB-EN-2023-SF20220922.pdf</a> .</p><h3 id=my-thought-around-structured-data>My thought around structured data</h3><p>Hackathons are always very time crunch like environments. I very much wanted us to have at least a minimal end to end demo in our back pocket just in case our additional progress does not pan out.</p><h4 id=so-on-the-first-night>So on the first night,</h4><p>I had this hunch, that the value we can get from our public facing document, would be highest, with additional preprocessing, turning the raw text from this document into full enlish sentences, as opposed to the incomplete English in the document, and also to capture some of the inferred structural connections which are easy to see when visually inspecting, but cannot be captured easily by a raw text dump from the pdf, because perhaps at least the initial pdf to text extraction which we used did not capture this structure.</p><h4 id=one-quick-example-of-this>One quick example of this,</h4><p>For instance, here are two tables from the pdf document, that describe the &ldquo;Mail Order Cost-Sharing&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Retail Cost-Sharing&rdquo; options for prescription drug benefits</p><p><img src=https://s3.amazonaws.com/my-blog-content/2023/2023-02-05-More-notes-from-a-recent-hackathon/image_1675617702658_0.png alt=image.png></p><p><img src=https://s3.amazonaws.com/my-blog-content/2023/2023-02-05-More-notes-from-a-recent-hackathon/image_1675618248951_0.png alt=image.png></p><p>At the outset I handrewrote this as the following clauses</p><pre tabindex=0><code>This plan has Prescription Drug Benefits .
Here is information about what You Pay for Vaccines .
Our plan covers most Part D vaccines at no cost to you, no matter what cost-sharing tier it’s on .

Here is information about What You Pay for Insulin .
You won’t pay more than $35 for a one-month (up to 30-day) supply of each Part D insulin product covered by our plan, no matter what cost-sharing tier it’s on . This applies to all Part D covered insulins, 
including the Select Insulins covered under the Insulin Savings Program as described below. 
What you pay for prescription drugs depends on whether you receive &#34;Extra Help&#34; or not.
 If you receive &#34;Extra Help&#34;, you will still pay no more than $35 for a one-month supply for each Part D covered insulin. 
Please see your Prescription Drug Guide to find all Part D insulins covered by your plan. 
This plan does not have a deductible for prescription drugs. 
If you don&#39;t receive Extra Help for your drugs, you&#39;ll pay a different amount based on the type of cost-sharing option you use.
For the Initial coverage, you are responsible to pay for a 30-day supply or a 90-day supply the amount based on the tier of the prescription drug. A prescription drug can be either in tier 1 preferred generic, tier 2 generic, tier 3 preferred brand, tier 4 non-preferred drug, or tier 5 specialty tier. You are responsible to pay for prescription drugs until the total yearly drug costs reach $4,660 . The total yearly drug costs are the total drug costs paid by both you and our plan. Once you reach this amount, you will enter the Coverage Gap. 
There are two different kinds of cost-sharing for prescription drugs, including Mail Order Cost-Sharing and Retail Cost-Sharing. There are two different kinds of Mail Order pharmacy options, Standard and Preferred. The Mail order pharmacy option called Standard includes Walmart Mail, PillPack and other pharmacies that are also available in our network. To find pharmacy mail order options go to Humana.com/pharmacyfinder  . The second type of mail order pharmacy option is the Preferred pharmacy option, which includes only the CenterWell Pharmacy.
For the Standard Mail order pharmacy option, for Tier 1 Preferred Generic drugs, the 30-day supply costs $10 and the 90-day supply costs $30.
For the Standard Mail order pharmacy option, for Tier 2 Generic drugs, the 30-day supply costs $20 and the 90-day supply costs $60.
For the Standard Mail order pharmacy option, for Tier 3 Preferred Brand drugs, the 30-day supply costs $47 and the 90-day supply costs $141.
For the Standard Mail order pharmacy option, for Tier 4 Non-Preferred drugs, the 30-day supply costs $100 and the 90-day supply costs $300.
For the Standard Mail order pharmacy option, for Tier 5 Specialty Tier drugs, the 30-day supply costs 33% and the 90-day supply is not available.
For the Preferred CenterWell Pharmacy Mail order pharmacy option, for Tier 1 Preferred Generic drugs, the 30-day supply costs $0 and the 90-day supply costs $0.
For the Preferred CenterWell Pharmacy Mail order pharmacy option, for Tier 2 Generic drugs, the 30-day supply costs $0 and the 90-day supply costs $0.
For the Preferred CenterWell Pharmacy Mail order pharmacy option, for Tier 3 Preferred Brand drugs, the 30-day supply costs $42 and the 90-day supply costs $116.
For the Preferred CenterWell Pharmacy Mail order pharmacy option, for Tier 4 Non-Preferred drugs, the 30-day supply costs $100 and the 90-day supply costs $290.
For the Preferred CenterWell Pharmacy Mail order pharmacy option, for Tier 5 Specialty Tier drugs, the 30-day supply costs 33% and the 90-day supply is not available.
The other kind of prescription drug cost sharing is called Retail Cost-Sharing, which means that you can physically go to the pharmacy. You can go to any network retail pharmacy.  To find the retail pharmacies near you, go to Humana.com/pharmacyfinder 
For the retail pharmacy option, for Tier 1 Preferred Generic drugs, the 30-day supply costs $0 and the 90-day supply costs $0.
For the retail pharmacy option, for Tier 2 Generic drugs, the 30-day supply costs $0 and the 90-day supply costs $0.
For the retail pharmacy option, for Tier 3 Preferred Brand drugs, the 30-day supply costs $42 and the 90-day supply costs $116.
For the retail pharmacy option, for Tier 4 Non-Preferred drugs, the 30-day supply costs $100 and the 90-day supply costs $300.
For the retail pharmacy option, for Tier 5 Specialty Tier drugs, the 30-day supply costs 33% and the 90-day supply is not available.
</code></pre><p>Maybe there are really good libraries for inferring the generically inferring the tabular structure , but at least for the time being I really wanted to constrain the problem a bit more since my brain was in hackathon mode haha 😅</p><h3 id=a-fully-end-to-end-version-1-demo>A fully end to end version 1 demo</h3><p>So the <a href=https://michal.piekarczyk.xyz/post/2023-02-01-lang-chain-small-talk/>day before</a> I had already proven to myself, that the #langchain <code>LLMChain</code> class is really good at having a targeted conversation framed around some kind of small talk, with the use of a prompt that provides the focus. Also , <a href=https://michal.piekarczyk.xyz/post/2023-01-29-lang-chain-quick-look/>earlier</a>, I had shown myself just how quickly haha, no, instantaneously, you can use #langchain to embed a targeted bit of text, a section of a magazine article in my case, and run question answering based on this.</p><p>I have not tried it yet but langchain also has the concept of an agent, which can compartmentalize separate functionality, say for engaging in small talk and separately for answering questions on an insurance plan document.</p><p>Already having some components already working in front of me, I wanted to at least first build a super simple demo, more or less jamming together the small talk prompts I had explored earlier with the document focused question answering.</p><h4 id=i-ended-up-with-something-like-this>I ended up with something like this</h4><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-python data-lang=python><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#f92672>from</span> langchain <span style=color:#f92672>import</span> OpenAI, ConversationChain, LLMChain, PromptTemplate
