But not all strategies are as useful and rote learning is overrated and recall like spaced repetition is where the benefit is. Sleep and taking walks is the learning multiplier enabling diffuse mode you don‚Äôt benefit from if you are trying to just focus really hard on something.\nImpact The after the fact synthesis summary you do after immersing in an article or podcast or meeting is better than no synthesis at all. The story was of someone painting a subject, but by making observations in one room and then going to another room to do the painting. This forced the painter to actively recall from memory. And this is like putting something in your own words but with a delay. The reference I wrote down here was a research paper by [[Jeffrey D. Karpicke]] about recall. This very much reminds me of preventing #overfitting as in the [[ML]] sense. I think this article may have been linked from the course, about that 30 second synthesis concept. Learned from my friend Zeph this is like the #upshot .\n‚ÄúIf your inner writing brain and editing brain are in the same car, only one can drive at any one time‚Äù. üòÄ. [[Daphne Gray Grant]] , one of the interviews , with this editor, she said to separate the writing from the editing. This is really helpful, because I have spent a lot of time doing both writing and editing at the same time and I realize now that is really slow. Just get it out and then edit later. ‚ÄúWrite with your diffuse thinking brain and don‚Äôt write with your editing brain!‚Äù I like the way she put it that, She had a interesting point too about avoiding [[linear]] thinking also, like write in a [[landscape-paper]] to write more broadly . Yea I remember adapting this a while back from this professor ,\nTake a break ! Many of the experts interviewed said they benefited from stepping away from problems they were trying to solve that would not yield. Including [[Keith Devlin]], And also that [[nose to grind stone]] quote, [[Dr Norman Fortenberry]] , he said , about diffuse thinking that yes you end up often putting your nose to the grindstone but there are people out there walking around without noses, so don‚Äôt grind too much else you grind away too much. haha üòÖ. [[turn off your brain]] [[chill out]]\nPlanning learning can be overwhelming, so focus on that [[do that one next thing]] And a interesting tip is to plant seeds of your next day sort of end of the day, as a kind of using sleep strategy for preparing for that next day\nSummary of take aways Picking up from [[Andrew Huberman/Goals Toolkit]], the discomfort of the challenge of not knowing something is the curiosity potential that seems to drive you towards this unknown. Writing notes during vs after. I also had a physics professor in school who pointed out to me , to put my pen down so i could more immerse in what he was showing. And I get that the extension of the above is the [[learn-do-show-loop]] [[learn-do-explain-loop]] The input and the output Funny enough this reminded me of the [[decoupling]] suggested in [[book/Philosophy of Software Design]] splitting away #UI , so the input and output separation, the input is like the UI of your life. That is the part you can influence. Haha. üòÖ. Of course [[Indistractable book]] [[Nir Eyal]] helps cement this for me too. Rich and strong Connections [[Nelson Dellis]] , in an interview, mentioned from the [[memory palace]] perspective, strengthening associations, letting concepts share space in your mind with what is already familiar to you. Building on what already exists vs what is totally new. But haha this reminds me of that anecdote, when I started learning [[chopin]] [[√©tudes]], [[Chopin etude op 10 no 1]] and others I remember reading through a [[Alfred Cortot]] book, that Chopin‚Äôs Etudes are haha not really simple things you learn but more like how to unlearn all of the things you probably learned haha probably all wrong. But that makes sense actually, [[two steps forward one step back]], this is the painful experience but it is as true in [[strength training]] as in learning.\nAdditional Questions The learning path can be winding and chaotic. It can feel good in the moment but can end up being a bit like #[[rabbit hole]] at times. Is it better to set limits or let research go where it leads? Related though, I enjoyed this interview with [[John Maguire]], about writing. He said, one, favor clarity over sounding impressive, using [[Plain language]], like [[Steven Pinker]] [[classic style]] , but particularly, when stuck, aka [[writers-block]], write what is the [[do that one next thing]], whicch much reminds me of the [[agile]] [[acceptance criteria]]\nAnd the [[procrastination]] topic. So I understand how procrastination can get in the way, especially per [[Tim Urban]] story, but I do think about [[creative-procrastination]] and also [[help others as procrastination]] . And even think back to this [[tv-show/Dr House]] , where [[person Hugh Laurie]] [[doctor house hugh laurie show]] had his doctors solve sort of seemingly unrelated problems because I think looking back that activated their [[diffuse thinking]] , letting their brains churn on the harder problem in the background . But like I think [[Keith Devlin]] pointed out, you have to do the hard part first, you have to try try [[try try again]] initially, #exhaustive-search in the problem space in front of you and then #stepping-away . It was his [[thinking doing thinking loop]] . Also [[Barbara Oakley]] pointing out the [[funnel of demands on your time]] and [[single-tasking]] , which reminds me of [[multi-tackling]] also, where at any one time you are focusing but you can take a break by switching to some other problem actually when you [[hit wall]].\nreminds me of [[instant-gratification-monkey]] and [[Tim Urban]] who had that crazy #[[TED talk]]\n{{query (and [[course/Learning How to Learn]] [[take-away]] [[TODO]] ) }}\n","wordCount":"1053","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-09-10T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-09-10T18:05:40-04:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Michal Piekarczyk"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://michal.piekarczyk.xyz/post/2023-09-10-summary-learning-how-to-learn-coursera/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"michal.piekarczyk.xyz","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://michal.piekarczyk.xyz/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://michal.piekarczyk.xyz/ accesskey=h title="michal.piekarczyk.xyz (Alt + H)">michal.piekarczyk.xyz</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://michal.piekarczyk.xyz/post/ title=posts><span>posts</span></a></li><li><a href=https://michal.piekarczyk.xyz/project/ title=projects><span>projects</span></a></li><li><a href=https://michal.piekarczyk.xyz/handy/ title=handy><span>handy</span></a></li><li><a href=https://michal.piekarczyk.xyz/search/ title="search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>search</span></a></li><li><a href=https://michal.piekarczyk.xyz/about/ title=about><span>about</span></a></li><li><a href=https://world.hey.com/michal.piekarczyk title=frivolity><span>frivolity</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://michal.piekarczyk.xyz/>Home</a>&nbsp;¬ª&nbsp;<a href=https://michal.piekarczyk.xyz/post/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>summary learning how to learn coursera</h1><div class=post-meta>&lt;span title='2023-09-10 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>September 10, 2023&lt;/span>&amp;nbsp;¬∑&amp;nbsp;5 min&amp;nbsp;¬∑&amp;nbsp;1053 words&amp;nbsp;¬∑&amp;nbsp;Michal Piekarczyk</div></header><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#the-after-the-fact-synthesis-summary-you-do-after-immersing>The after the fact synthesis summary you do after immersing</a></li><li><a href=#if-your-inner-writing-brain-and-editing-brain-are-in-the-same-car-only-one-can-drive-at-any-one-time->&ldquo;If your inner writing brain and editing brain are in the same car, only one can drive at any one time&rdquo;. üòÄ.</a></li><li><a href=#take-a-break->Take a break !</a></li><li><a href=#planning-learning-can-be-overwhelming-so-focus-on-that-do-that-one-next-thing>Planning learning can be overwhelming, so focus on that [[do that one next thing]]</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><h1 id=what>What<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#what>#</a></h1><p>On Coursera [[Barbara Oakley]] Learning How to Learn
