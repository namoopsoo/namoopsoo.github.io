Here is more or less what transpired.\nIn the Analysis tool, I upload a csv file that I exported from Carb Manager and I opened with this question below.\nMe Can you plot the calories per day over time ?\nData Analysis Sure, I can help with that. I’ll start by loading and examining the data from the file you’ve uploaded to understand its structure. Then, I’ll plot the calories per day over time. Let’s begin by loading the data. The data contains multiple columns, but for plotting calories per day, we’ll focus on the ‘Date’ and ‘Calories’ columns. I’ll sum up the calories for each day and then create a plot showing the total daily calories over time. Let’s proceed with this analysis. Here’s the plot showing the total calories per day over time. This visualization provides an overview of your calorie intake trends. If you have any specific aspects you’d like to focus on or any other data analysis needs, feel free to let me know!\nMe Can you plot average daily protein over time , group by month\nData Analysis Certainly! To plot the average daily protein intake grouped by month, I will first need to locate the relevant column for protein in your dataset. After identifying this column, I’ll calculate the average daily protein intake for each month and then create a plot to visualize this data over time. Let’s proceed with identifying the protein column. The column for protein intake in your dataset is labeled as ‘Protein (g)’. I’ll use this column to calculate the average daily protein intake for each month. Then, I’ll plot this information to show how the average protein intake varied over time, grouped by month. Let’s proceed with the analysis. Here’s the plot showing the average daily protein intake per month over time. This visualization illustrates how your protein consumption has varied on a monthly basis. If you have any more specific analysis or different aspects of your data you’d like to explore, please feel free to ask!\nCommentary So I noticed this looked strangely low, as if the summing was not happening somehow. We should be seeing 100g plus.\nMe This is not quite what I meant, this is doing a group by of all the rows in a month and finding the average protein . However I’m interested in the daily average and so I mean let’s get the sum of protein for each day and then group by month to get the average daily sum of protein over time . Sorry I was not precise .\nData Analysis Thank you for the clarification. To provide the analysis you’re looking for, I’ll first calculate the total protein intake for each day. Then, I’ll group these daily totals by month and calculate the average daily protein intake for each month. This will give us the average of daily sums of protein intake, month by month. Let’s proceed with this updated approach. Here is the updated plot showing the average of daily sums of protein intake per month over time. This graph provides a view of how the average daily protein consumption has trended on a monthly basis. If there’s anything else you’d like to analyze or any other questions, feel free to let me know!\nCommentary Still low. These numbers should be in the hundreds to two hundreds.\nMe For some reason the average of the daily sums looks really low. Can we plot a histogram of the daily protein sums for all time ?\nData Analysis Certainly! Plotting a histogram of the daily protein sums will provide insight into the distribution of your daily protein intake over the entire time period. This can help us understand why the average might seem low, as it will show the range and frequency of daily protein intake values. Let’s create that histogram. Here’s the histogram showing the distribution of daily protein sums. This visualization gives you an idea of the range and frequency of your daily protein intake values. If you have any specific questions about this distribution or if there’s anything else you’d like to explore, feel free to ask!\nMe Okay this seems to show there are many days with a suspiciously low daily protein sum. Can we look at this histogram but only for daily protein sums that are below 50?\nData Analysis Absolutely, focusing on the days with daily protein sums below 50 grams will give us a clearer view of the lower end of the distribution. I’ll create a histogram that only includes days where the total protein intake was less than 50 grams. Let’s see what that looks like. Here’s the histogram focusing on days with daily protein sums below 50 grams. This gives a detailed look at the distribution of your lower protein intake days. If you have any further questions or need additional analysis, please let me know!\nCommentary Ok I realized that maybe the problem is that since the Carb Manager csv also includes “activity” data, that is interfering with the analysis.\nMe Okay I have a feeling the problem is that this dataset includes rows with two kinds of data , one kind of data does not contain protein data and that missing data must have been filled in as 0. Lets first drop all the rows that have empty or missing values for protein and then let’s plot the histogram of the daily protein sum\nData Analysis That’s a good approach. By filtering out rows where the protein data is missing or recorded as zero, we can get a more accurate representation of the actual protein intake. I will remove these rows and then plot the histogram of the daily protein sums again. Let’s proceed with this updated analysis. Here’s the updated histogram of daily protein sums using the filtered data, where rows with missing or zero protein values were excluded. This should provide a more accurate picture of your actual daily protein intake. If there’s anything else you’d like to explore or analyze, feel free to let me know!\nMe Looks like there are still over 1750 days with less than 10 grams daily sum of protein. Still weird. Ok using the filtered dataset where the missing protein rows are dropped, let’s look at the raw data for the five days that have the lowest protein sums.\nData Analysis To investigate further, I’ll identify and display the data for the five days with the lowest protein sums from the filtered dataset. This will help us understand what might be contributing to these unusually low protein intake days. Let’s take a look at those specific days.\nHere is the raw data for the five days with the lowest protein sums in the filtered dataset:\nDate: 2022-04-06 20:35 - Meal: Dinner - Item: Butter - Protein: Not listed but assumed low due to the nature of the item. Date: 2022-04-13 21:46 - Meal: Dinner - Item: Margarine - Protein: Not listed but assumed low. Date: 2022-05-02 18:59 - Meal: Dinner - Item: Butter - Protein: Not listed but assumed low. Date: 2022-08-20 23:01 - Meal: Dinner - Item: Champagne - Protein: Not listed but assumed low. Date: 2022-09-17 17:14 - Meal: Lunch - Item: Red wine - Protein: Not listed but assumed low. It seems that these days are recorded with items that typically have very low or negligible protein content. This might explain why these days have such low protein sums. If you have any further questions or need additional insights, please let me know!\nMe For the date 2022-04-06, I added by hand the protein column, I think it is about 111. What sum of protein do you get for that date ?\nData Analysis To determine the sum of protein for the date 2022-04-06, I’ll look at the data for that specific date. Let’s calculate the total protein intake for that day. It appears that the sum of protein intake for the date 2022-04-06 in the filtered dataset is 0 grams. However, since you mentioned adding protein data manually, it’s possible that this information was not captured in the dataset I have. If you have updated data, you may upload it for analysis, or we can review and adjust the dataset accordingly.\nMe Let’s look at the dataset for the date 2022-04-06, showing only the columns, date, item, type and protein.\nData Analysis It appears that there are no rows in the dataset for the date 2022-04-06 with non-null protein values in the columns you specified (Date, Item, Type, and Protein). This suggests that either the data for this date is missing or the protein values for this date are all null or zero. If you have updated or additional data that includes the protein values for this date, you can upload it for analysis. Otherwise, if there are specific adjustments or corrections you’d like to make based on your knowledge of the data, please let me know how to proceed.\nMe Maybe let’s try a different approach. Let’s start from the original dataset. Let’s filter one by rows where the type column is “Food”. Now let’s look at this for the date 2022-04-06, showing only the columns, date, item, type and protein.\nData Analysis It appears that there are no rows in the filtered dataset (where ‘Type’ is ‘Food’) for the date 2022-04-06 with the columns Date, Item, Type, and Protein. This suggests that there might not be any food entries recorded for this specific date in the dataset. If you believe there should be data for this date, it’s possible that the data might not have been recorded or included in the dataset provided. If you have an updated dataset or additional information that you’d like to analyze, feel free to upload it. Alternatively, if there’s another aspect of the data you’d like to explore, let me know how I can assist you further.\nMe Ok I think it’s because in the original dataset , the date column includes time too, and so we will not get an exact match . Instead, let’s start with the original dataset , Let’s start from the original dataset. Let’s filter one by rows where the type column is “Food”. Now let’s look at this where the date column, treated as a string, starts with, 2022-04-06, showing only the columns, date, item, type and protein.\nData Analysis Here is the data for the date 2022-04-06, filtered to include only rows where the ‘Type’ column is ‘Food’. The data shows the ‘Date’, ‘Item’, ‘Type’, and ‘Protein (g)’ for each food entry on that day:\nButter: 0.02g of protein Avocado: 1.86g of protein Athletic Greens AG1: 2.00g of protein DigInnChickenBroccoliCarrotsHorseRad: 50.61g of protein Walnuts: 4.87g of protein Simply Delish Naturel Dessert A La Gelee De Fr...: 0.00g of protein Eggs, cooked: 12.58g of protein Blueberries: 0.55g of protein Dig Inn Meatball with Tomato Ragu: 5.00g of protein Fage 5% Milkfat Greek Yogurt: 26.47g of protein Nirvana 85% Dark Chocolate: 7.50g of protein If you need further analysis or have other questions regarding this data, feel free to ask!\nMe Let’s start from the original dataset. Rename the date column to “timestamp”. Let’s filter by rows where the type column is “Food”. Next let’s create a new column, “date”, which has only the date from the “timestamp” column. Now let’s group by date, and get the sum of protein . And let’s look at the histogram of this sum of protein.\nData Analysis. It seems there was an issue executing the last step. This might be due to the way the ‘Timestamp’ column is being processed or the creation of the new ‘Date’ column. Let me correct this and retry the analysis. It seems there’s a persistent issue with the execution of this step, possibly related to the data handling or plotting process. To resolve this, I’ll try a different approach to ensure the analysis is completed successfully. Let’s give it another attempt. I encountered another issue with executing the code. It seems there might be a specific problem with the dataset or the process I’m using. To ensure we can proceed, I’ll try a simplified approach to plot the histogram. Let’s see if this works. ​​ It appears that the issue persists despite the simplified approach. This could be due to an unexpected characteristic of the data or a technical limitation in the current environment. As an alternative, I can guide you through the steps to perform this analysis on your own system using Python, or we can explore other aspects of your data. Let me know how you’d like to proceed!\nCommentary I looked at the outputs of code, but I did not see errors actually, so I asked,\nMe I don’t see the error, could you please share the error?\nData analysis I apologize for the inconvenience, but I’m unable to directly view or share specific error messages from the code execution environment. This limitation makes it challenging to diagnose the precise issue causing the repeated failures. If you’re familiar with Python, I can provide the code snippet for you to run in your own environment, where you’ll be able to see any error messages and potentially troubleshoot the issue more effectively. Alternatively, if there’s another way you’d like to proceed with the analysis or a different question, I’m here to assist!\nCommentary Ok at this point I went ahead to my laptop, and I tried out the code that was running into a problem, from a jupyter lab notebook.\nimport pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from pathlib import Path from dotenv import dotenv_values config = dotenv_values(\".env\") datadir = Path(config[\"DATA_DIR\"]) / \"CarbManager\" path = datadir / \"daily_logs_20211008-20231014_2d32df41-3d04-42db-a858-0eaa117b80ba.csv\" data = pd.read_csv(path) Ok let’s try to rerun the problematic code Ok below, I more or less copy-pasted the below from the Chat GPT output, except I just needed to replace the plotting using the plt directly, with a fig, ax = plt.subplots() style because the axes come out invisible on a dark layout, and I wanted to make use of fig.patch.set_facecolor('xkcd:mint green') to make the background there visible.\nBut other than that, the original code is below.\n# Starting from the original dataset data_renamed = data.copy() # Renaming 'Date' to 'Timestamp' data_renamed.rename(columns={'Date': 'Timestamp'}, inplace=True) # Filtering by rows where 'Type' is 'Food' food_data_renamed = data_renamed[data_renamed['Type'] == 'Food'] # Creating a new column 'Date' which has only the date from the 'Timestamp' column food_data_renamed['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(food_data_renamed['Timestamp']).dt.date # Grouping by 'Date' and getting the sum of protein grouped_protein_data = food_data_renamed.groupby('Date')['Protein (g)'].sum().reset_index() # Plotting the histogram of the sum of protein fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 6))#plt.figure() fig.patch.set_facecolor('xkcd:mint green') fig.tight_layout() ax.hist(grouped_protein_data['Protein (g)'], bins=30, color='blue', edgecolor='black') ax.set_title('Histogram of Sum of Protein per Day') ax.set_xlabel('Daily Protein Intake (g)') ax.set_ylabel('Frequency') ax.grid(axis='y', alpha=0.75) plt.show() Then it did work? I see per my above run that the code that Chat GPT was running into an issue with, was actually correct for me, correctly stripping the hour minute data from the timestamps, helping to group by date and getting rid of the weird 0-skewed histogram problem.\nSo a time plot now So finally since the above correction shows the histogram is normal now, then let’s use the original time plot code, but let me tweak that slightly with the correction of using the Date derived from the timestamp.\n# Starting from the original dataset data_renamed = data.copy() # Renaming 'Date' to 'Timestamp' data_renamed.rename(columns={'Date': 'Timestamp'}, inplace=True) # Filtering by rows where 'Type' is 'Food' food_data_renamed = data_renamed[data_renamed['Type'] == 'Food'] # Creating a new column 'Date' which has only the date from the 'Timestamp' column food_data_renamed['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(pd.to_datetime(food_data_renamed['Timestamp']).dt.date) # Calculating the total protein intake for each day daily_protein_total = food_data_renamed.groupby('Date')['Protein (g)'].sum().reset_index() # Grouping these daily totals by month and calculating the average daily protein intake for each month daily_protein_total['Month'] = daily_protein_total['Date'].dt.to_period('M') monthly_avg_daily_protein = daily_protein_total.groupby('Month')['Protein (g)'].mean().reset_index() # Converting 'Month' back to datetime for plotting monthly_avg_daily_protein['Month'] = monthly_avg_daily_protein['Month'].dt.to_timestamp() # Plotting the average of daily sums of protein intake per month over time fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 6)) fig.patch.set_facecolor('xkcd:mint green') # fig.tight_layout() ax.plot(monthly_avg_daily_protein['Month'], monthly_avg_daily_protein['Protein (g)'], color='orange') ax.set_title('Average of Daily Sums of Protein Intake per Month Over Time') ax.set_xlabel('Month') ax.set_ylabel('Average Daily Protein (g)') ax.grid(True) plt.show() Ok above looking much better now. And some weirdness with the very beginning, but hopefully explainable.\nOk in conclusion I am observing that the amount of knowledge I need to have about the problem, was high. I needed to realize there was a separate set of “activity” row data that had no protein information which was likely contributing to imputation and low protein averages. And it seems that I needed to plug in a lot of theories about what the possible problems were in general. I needed to jump in about casting the timestamps to dates. In the end the code was having some execution issues on the Chat GPT side but that will probably be fixed at some point. The code basically ran fine on my laptop.\nBut my impression is that natural language is a kind of approximation to code that is open to interpretation, whereas code is much more precise. I am seeing that natural language to code is a great way to kick start an analysis, but you may need a lot of domain and analytical knowledge to wrangle the problem anyway. And how do you get that domain and analytical knowledge? Well you need to have gotten your hands dirty with the code.\nI think the transformer architecture, this year, has shown me that the output very much mirrors the input and by design. That makes it remind me of the FOIA process otherwise known as the Freedom of Information Act process whereby you can get closed government documents, but only if you know what to ask for. So the current state of Chat GPT Analysis seems like FOIA. If you know what to ask for, it will deliver.\nVery likely, with additional rich diagnostic data around debugging and problem solving, we will likely get a much more perceptive set of models soon. And it is likely that the Chat GPT of today actually already has all of that diagnostic information at its disposal, but I just need to better learn 😅 what natural language I should use to cue the debug help better in the future. I am sure to try things like, so what do you think we should try next?.\n","wordCount":"3088","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-11-18T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-12-24T11:52:10-05:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Michal

GPT&rsquo;s new Data Analysis functionality<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#so-lets-try-out-chat-gpts-new-data-analysis-functionality>#</a></h1><p>I passed in my multi-year food log dump from Carb Manager and thought, can I plot the protein data. Here is more or less what transpired.</p><p>In the Analysis tool, I upload a csv file that I exported from Carb Manager and I opened with this question below.</p><h2 id=me>Me<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#me>#</a></h2><blockquote><p>Can you plot the calories per day over time ?</p></blockquote><h2 id=data-analysis>Data Analysis<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#data-analysis>#</a></h2><blockquote><p>Sure, I can help with that. I&rsquo;ll start by loading and examining the data from the file you&rsquo;ve uploaded to understand its structure. Then, I&rsquo;ll plot the calories per day over time. Let&rsquo;s begin by loading the data.
The data contains multiple columns, but for plotting calories per day, we&rsquo;ll focus on the &lsquo;Date&rsquo; and &lsquo;Calories&rsquo; columns. I&rsquo;ll sum up the calories for each day and then create a plot showing the total daily calories over time. Let&rsquo;s proceed with this analysis.<figure><img loading=lazy src=https://s3.amazonaws.com/my-blog-content/2023/2023-11-18-test-drive-chat-gpt-data-analysis/image_1700334661502_0.png width=70%></figure>Here&rsquo;s the plot showing the total calories per day over time. This visualization provides an overview of your calorie intake trends. If you have any specific aspects you&rsquo;d like to focus on or any other data analysis needs, feel free to let me know!</p></blockquote><h2 id=me-1>Me<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#me-1>#</a></h2><blockquote><p>Can you plot average daily protein over time , group by month</p></blockquote><h2 id=data-analysis-1>Data Analysis<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#data-analysis-1>#</a></h2><blockquote><p>Certainly! To plot the average daily protein intake grouped by month, I will first need to locate the relevant column for protein in your dataset. After identifying this column, I&rsquo;ll calculate the average daily protein intake for each month and then create a plot to visualize this data over time. Let&rsquo;s proceed with identifying the protein column.
The column for protein intake in your dataset is labeled as &lsquo;Protein (g)&rsquo;. I&rsquo;ll use this column to calculate the average daily protein intake for each month. Then, I&rsquo;ll plot this information to show how the average protein intake varied over time, grouped by month. Let&rsquo;s proceed with the analysis.<figure><img loading=lazy src=https://s3.amazonaws.com/my-blog-content/2023/2023-11-18-test-drive-chat-gpt-data-analysis/image_1700347773243_0.png width=70%></figure>Here&rsquo;s the plot showing the average daily protein intake per month over time. This visualization illustrates how your protein consumption has varied on a monthly basis. If you have any more specific analysis or different aspects of your data you&rsquo;d like to explore, please feel free to ask!</p></blockquote><h2 id=_commentary_><em>Commentary</em><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#_commentary_>#</a></h2><p>So I noticed this looked strangely low, as if the summing was not happening somehow. We should be seeing 100g plus.</p><h2 id=me-2>Me<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#me-2>#</a></h2><blockquote><p>This is not quite what I meant, this is doing a group by of all the rows in a month and finding the average protein . However I’m interested in the daily average and so I mean let’s get the sum of protein for each day and then group by month to get the average daily sum of protein over time . Sorry I was not precise .</p></blockquote><h2 id=data-analysis-2>Data Analysis<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#data-analysis-2>#</a></h2><blockquote><p>Thank you for the clarification. To provide the analysis you&rsquo;re looking for, I&rsquo;ll first calculate the total protein intake for each day. Then, I&rsquo;ll group these daily totals by month and calculate the average daily protein intake for each month. This will give us the average of daily sums of protein intake, month by month. Let&rsquo;s proceed with this updated approach.<figure><img loading=lazy src=https://s3.amazonaws.com/my-blog-content/2023/2023-11-18-test-drive-chat-gpt-data-analysis/image_1700348171903_0.png width=70%></figure>Here is the updated plot showing the average of daily sums of protein intake per month over time. This graph provides a view of how the average daily protein consumption has trended on a monthly basis.

These numbers should be in the hundreds to two hundreds.</p><h2 id=me-3>Me<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#me-3>#</a></h2><blockquote><p>For some reason the average of the daily sums looks really low. Can we plot a histogram of the daily protein sums for all time ?</p></blockquote><h2 id=data-analysis-3>Data Analysis<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#data-analysis-3>#</a></h2><blockquote><p>Certainly! Plotting a histogram of the daily protein sums will provide insight into the distribution of your daily protein intake over the entire time period. This can help us understand why the average might seem low, as it will show the range and frequency of daily protein intake values. Let&rsquo;s create that histogram.<figure><img loading=lazy src=https://s3.amazonaws.com/my-blog-content/2023/2023-11-18-test-drive-chat-gpt-data-analysis/image_1700349166520_0.png width=70%></figure>Here&rsquo;s the histogram showing the distribution of daily protein sums. This visualization gives you an idea of the range and frequency of your daily protein intake values. If you have any specific questions about this distribution or if there&rsquo;s anything else you&rsquo;d like to explore, feel free to ask!</p></blockquote><h2 id=me-4>Me<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#me-4>#</a></h2><blockquote><p>Okay this seems to show there are many days with a suspiciously low daily protein sum. Can we look at this histogram but only for daily protein sums that are below 50?</p></blockquote><h2 id=data-analysis-4>Data Analysis<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#data-analysis-4>#</a></h2><blockquote><p>Absolutely, focusing on the days with daily protein sums below 50 grams will give us a clearer view of the lower end of the distribution. I&rsquo;ll create a histogram that only includes days where the total protein intake was less than 50 grams. Let&rsquo;s see what that looks like.<figure><img loading=lazy src=https://s3.amazonaws.com/my-blog-content/2023/2023-11-18-test-drive-chat-gpt-data-analysis/image_1700351156591_0.png width=70%></figure>Here&rsquo;s the histogram focusing on days with daily protein sums below 50 grams. This gives a detailed look at the distribution of your lower protein intake days. If you have any further questions or need additional analysis, please let me know!</p></blockquote><h2 id=_commentary_-2><em>Commentary</em><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#_commentary_-2>#</a></h2><p>Ok I realized that maybe the problem is that since the Carb Manager csv also includes &ldquo;activity&rdquo; data, that is interfering with the analysis.</p><h2 id=me-5>Me<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#me-5>#</a></h2><blockquote><p>Okay I have a feeling the problem is that this dataset includes rows with two kinds of data , one kind of data does not contain protein data and that missing data must have been filled in as 0. Lets first drop all the rows that have empty or missing values for protein and then let’s plot the histogram of the daily protein sum</p></blockquote><h2 id=data-analysis-5>Data Analysis<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#data-analysis-5>#</a></h2><blockquote><p>That&rsquo;s a good approach. By filtering out rows where the protein data is missing or recorded as zero, we can get a more accurate representation of the actual protein intake. I will remove these rows and then plot the histogram of the daily protein sums again. Let&rsquo;s proceed with this updated analysis.<figure><img loading=lazy src=https://s3.amazonaws.com/my-blog-content/2023/2023-11-18-test-drive-chat-gpt-data-analysis/image_1700351254827_0.png width=70%></figure>Here&rsquo;s the updated histogram of daily protein sums using the filtered data, where rows with missing or zero protein values were excluded. This should provide a more accurate picture of your actual daily protein intake. If there&rsquo;s anything else you&rsquo;d like to explore or analyze, feel free to let me know!</p></blockquote><h2 id=me-6>Me<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#me-6>#</a></h2><blockquote><p>Looks like there are still over 1750 days with less than 10 grams daily sum of protein. Still weird. Ok using the filtered dataset where the missing protein rows are dropped, let’s look at the raw data for the five days that have the lowest protein sums.</p></blockquote><h2 id=data-analysis-6>Data Analysis<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#data-analysis-6>#</a></h2><blockquote><p>To investigate further, I&rsquo;ll identify and display the data for the five days with the lowest protein sums from the filtered dataset. This will help us understand what might be contributing to these unusually low protein intake days. Let&rsquo;s take a look at those specific days.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Here is the raw data for the five days with the lowest protein sums in the filtered dataset:</p></blockquote><pre tabindex=0><code>Date: 2022-04-06 20:35 - Meal: Dinner - Item: Butter - Protein: Not listed but assumed low due to the nature of the item.

Let&rsquo;s calculate the total protein intake for that day.
It appears that the sum of protein intake for the date 2022-04-06 in the filtered dataset is 0 grams. However, since you mentioned adding protein data manually, it&rsquo;s possible that this information was not captured in the dataset I have. If you have updated data, you may upload it for analysis, or we can review and adjust the dataset accordingly.</p></blockquote><h2 id=me-8>Me<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#me-8>#</a></h2><blockquote><p>Let’s look at the dataset for the date 2022-04-06, showing only the columns, date, item, type and protein.</p></blockquote><h2 id=data-analysis-8>Data Analysis<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#data-analysis-8>#</a></h2><blockquote><p>It appears that there are no rows in the dataset for the date 2022-04-06 with non-null protein values in the columns you specified (Date, Item, Type, and Protein).

I encountered another issue with executing the code. It seems there might be a specific problem with the dataset or the process I&rsquo;m using. To ensure we can proceed, I&rsquo;ll try a simplified approach to plot the histogram. Let&rsquo;s see if this works. ​​
It appears that the issue persists despite the simplified approach. This could be due to an unexpected characteristic of the data or a technical limitation in the current environment.

And some weirdness with the very beginning, but hopefully explainable.</p><h2 id=ok-in-conclusion>Ok in conclusion<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#ok-in-conclusion>#</a></h2><p>I am observing that the amount of knowledge I need to have about the problem, was high. I needed to realize there was a separate set of &ldquo;activity&rdquo; row data that had no protein information which was likely contributing to imputation and low protein averages. And it seems that I needed to plug in a lot of theories about what the possible problems were in general. I needed to jump in about casting the timestamps to dates. In the end the code was having some execution issues on the Chat GPT side but that will probably be fixed at some point. The code basically ran fine on my laptop.</p><p>But my impression is that natural language is a kind of approximation to code that is open to interpretation, whereas code is much more precise. I am seeing that natural language to code is a great way to kick start an analysis, but you may need a lot of domain and analytical knowledge to wrangle the problem anyway. And how do you get that domain and analytical knowledge? Well you need to have gotten your hands dirty with the code.</p><p>I think the transformer architecture, this year, has shown me that the output very much mirrors the input and by design. That makes it remind me of the FOIA process otherwise known as the Freedom of Information Act process whereby you can get closed government documents, but only if you know what to ask for. So the current state of Chat GPT Analysis seems like FOIA. If you know what to ask for, it will deliver.</p><p>Very likely, with additional rich diagnostic data around debugging and problem solving, we will likely get a much more perceptive set of models soon. And it is likely that the Chat GPT of today actually already has all of that diagnostic information at its disposal, but I just need to better learn 😅 what natural language I should use to cue the debug help better in the future. I am sure to try things like, <em>so what do you think we should try next?</em>.</p><h2 id=heading><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#heading>#</a></h2></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://michal.piekarczyk.xyz/post/2023-12-09-imessage-export/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Exporting messages from Apple imessages</span>
