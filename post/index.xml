      <description>Inspiration Haha so per the joke of a friend about &amp;ldquo;Reynaud&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rdquo; sounds like &amp;ldquo;Raymond&amp;rdquo; as in &amp;ldquo;Everyone loves Raymond&amp;rdquo; , I was wondering, can sentence transformers tell the difference? But haha spoiler alert sort is is that if a model finds this funny then that might also not really understand the medical condition at play here , haha nervous laughter, 😅
Quick look let&amp;rsquo;s compare this first embedding model
import os from sentence_transformers.</description>

      <description>public:: true blog-date:: 2023-06-13 Ok continuing from last time, where I ran sentence_transformers model &#39;msmarco-MiniLM-L-6-v3&#39; against a code search problem of comparing query lines against a source code corpus actually from the sentence_transformers github
This time, I wanted to write some code around measuring the successful hits from a model run using cosine similarity from sentence_transformers
Query set choice I expanded the set of queries slightly, but not that much yet so I could focus on the evaluation code.</description>

      <description>public:: true blog-date:: 2023-06-12
briefly Inspired by the super popular #[[schrodinger logseq plugin]], I wrote up something in #python today, to publish to #Hugo like https://github.com/sawhney17/logseq-schrodinger but also with support for block embeds.
In particular, I was also really inspired by [[Bas Grolleman]]&amp;rsquo;s concept here around how to be able to use #interstitial-journaling and be able to nicely coalesce selected sources through their block embeds, into a target logseq concept they all refer to.</description>

      <description>public:: true blog_date:: 2023-06-11 The idea here was to try out Sentence Transformers , https://sbert.net , on source code search. And as a first stab, a corpus was built with, hey why not, the code from the #sentence-transformers repo.
The documentation at https://www.sbert.net/examples/applications/semantic-search/README.html#python was used for the basic test here. And a small bit of code at the bottom here, shows how the lines from the python source files were written to a python list first.</description>

      <description>This is a school English class project on philosophy from around 2004 where I recruited friends and family to do the voice acting of Spinoza and Descartes 😂. Glad this did not get lost.
My brother and uncle are voicing here Scene 1 Scene 2 Scene 3 Scene 4 George and Eugene Here is the second set of voice acting.

      <title>A diabetes summary (draft)</title>

      <description>TLDR Diabetes is what happens when high blood sugar wreaks havoc on the body because either with type I diabetes, the pancreas cannot produce insulin for various reasons or with type II diabetes, no matter how much insulin the pancreas produces, it is not enough insulin to meet the high levels of blood sugar because of insulin resistance (insulin is ignored by cells and blood sugar is not taken up). But fortunately dietary carbohydrate is the main lever here.</description>

      <description>Context Per an earlier on-going interlude, I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to more easily curate the photos I care to reference in passing in a conversation. This started out as deduping photos and splitting out the photos of food, but at some point I realized I have so many photos I take as notes, taking those out by hand was getting tedious. I used this as an opportunity to test chat GPT&amp;rsquo;s code-generating skills.</description>

      <description>Github Pages build queued for a day &amp;#34;Waiting for a runner to pick up this job&amp;#34; But I was excited to release a date fix The dates on hugo posts were funky since switching to PaperMod, like &amp;ldquo;121212-34-7878&amp;rdquo;
But I was reading newer hugo uses date_format instead of dateFormat.
Anyway I had a typo because I had DateFormat , would not have worked anyway.
But I could not publish this!</description>

      <description>Draft status Note haha, this is highly in draft mode, but I like to publish my early drafts because iterating is my preferred psychological happy place. But yea this is definitely not organized writing yet.
Book in three sentences We escape what we intend to do when it makes us uncomfortable, but we can learn to notice the impulse to escape and stay with ( lean in ) the discomfort a little bit at a time You control your input and not your output, so align the input with your values and forgive yourself (be kind )for crappy outcomes.</description>

      <description>First Stab at Alternate Day Feasting Wait Don&amp;rsquo;t you mean Alternate Day Fasting? Haha yes but I am still working up to the level of stoicism required to do proper Alternate Day Fasting and a low stress life also helps especially if you rely on snacks to counter the stress of the daily Work-From-Home-Wake-Up-Surprise-You-Are-At-Work-And-Work-Throughout-The-Entire-Day-Life haha!
But having already been doing Time Restricted Feeding for several years now, I think I have the stoicism requirements to at least give Alternate Day Feasting a go, which is basically aiming at calorie restriction every other day.</description>

      <description>Quick note, I had moved to the PaperMod theme last month and have been slowly fixing a few things that borked. Images disappeared? So first, my images disappeared all together , from this post I had them like
&amp;lt;table&amp;gt; &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt; &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;#34;https://my-blog-content.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/06/06/wahoo/2020-06-06+11.39.42.png&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;30%&amp;#34;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt; &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;#34;https://my-blog-content.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/06/06/wahoo/2020-06-06+11.39.49.png&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;30%&amp;#34; /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt; &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;#34;https://my-blog-content.s3.amazonaws.com/2020/06/06/wahoo/2020-06-06+11.44.39.png&amp;#34; width=&amp;#34;30%&amp;#34; /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/table&amp;gt; and I had to change them to be using the hugo language, below, then I saw the images again.</description>

      <description>So my friend and I were discussing the general topic of what happens to our employability as people once we reach the age of retirement. My feelings on this are I am hopeful and I think people can retain their skills and probably express different kinds of skills too. (some call this wisdom =D ).
At this point my friend introduced some dark humor, citing this link with an actuarial table, saying that,</description>

Note This is not a blog post but kind of a landing page I&amp;rsquo;m using to aggregate on-going project notes here
Vision Broadly would like to do here something like the following
compare against arbitrary #job-listings , #job-description , And [[my projects/personal/langchain-interview-me-2023-feb]] , also now the repo usable by anyone who wants to compare their #brag-document to #job-listings [[job-description]] out there , get a delta , and more broadly , understand say , their industry posture , since that’s a moving target .</description>

      <description>Premise Ok, got this half baked idea , combine my #brag-document with the available [[langchain]] QA chains into a proof of concept maybe I can call [[langchain interview me 2023-feb]]
So I&amp;rsquo;m going to throw a bunch of my source material together, language based, accessible as plain text doc, and then I will run the Link examples that provide references, citations,
Ok, so for accumulating my information, import yaml import tempfile from pathlib import Path from datetime import datetime import pytz def utc_now(): return datetime.</description>

      <description>Spending a few spare moments to summarize some of my thought processes from a recent hackathon.
What is all this So I was glad to be part of a really cool hackathon team recently at my company and here are some of my perspectives from the experience.
Plan of action So We settled to constrain our problem space to apply langchain, a library that wraps around large language model APIs notably the OpenAI API, to show language understanding from a publicly available health insurance plan summary of benefits document.</description>

      <guid>https://michal.piekarczyk.xyz/post/2023-01-31-lang-chain-try-prompt-engineering/</guid>
      <description>So I wonder would you use a prompt template with the name of the person maybe as an input variable, prior to a free chat open ended conversation?
I am particularly super curious can we use prompt engineering to convey that the person on the other end is a customer say, so they might use personal pronouns like &amp;ldquo;my&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;me&amp;rdquo;, etc ? Using https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/memory/examples/chatgpt_clone.html to help try this.
from langchain import OpenAI, ConversationChain, LLMChain, PromptTemplate from langchain.</description>

      <description>Okay let me try that lang chain demo 19:23 ok yea looking at https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys I did not have an api key yet, so lets try that out. how can one use https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain for [[question-answer-task]] over documentation ? https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/use_cases/question_answering.html 19:33 wow really cool so https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/use_cases/question_answering.html#adding-in-sources this says this can provide the sources used in answering a question ! nice 19:37 ok so first per https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/getting_started.html here, installing this stuff,
creating a new environment on my laptop pip install langchain pip install openai pip install faiss-cpu # adding this here after the fact after getting below error 20:11 got one error, ValueError: Could not import faiss python package.</description>

But I want a nice photo stream and my food diary is not part of that at all haha. So after manually moving food photos out, ultimately I stumbled upon Daniel Bourke&amp;rsquo;s Food Not Food repo, https://github.com/mrdbourke/food-not-food .
This was great I thought but I had some challenges getting this code off the ground, so here are my notes where ultimately I forked this, https://github.</description>

      <description>[[my backprop SGD from scratch 2022-Aug]] 13:16 so per yesterday, wondering why is it that the network I have is producing basically the same result , around 0.48 for any inputs. And that&amp;apos;s true both in my original matrix-multiplication code and manually constructed too. So lets say for a simple network, y_prob = sigmoid(x1*w1 + x2*w2) where x1 and x2 are also outputs of sigmoids, in (0, 1) , what are possible values for y_prob ?</description>

      <description>ok [[my backprop SGD from scratch 2022-Aug]] looking over results from last time, indeed so strange how microbatch loss was going back and forth and eventually trending that the plot of my change in loss, is increasing. deltas = [x[&amp;quot;loss_after&amp;quot;] - x[&amp;quot;loss_before&amp;quot;] for x in metrics[&amp;quot;micro_batch_updates&amp;quot;]] although initially the values were some negatives, as well. But I wonder does it indeed something is terribly wrong if this number ever goes up at all?</description>

      <description>I have no idea how I managed to get on my bus to DC this morning. My Citibike station I planned on, was full, then my phone is Unavailable until like 10:42 .
Bus boards at 11:00am . Still got to find a citibike dock to park the bike, because the stolen citibike fee is $1,250. At 10:42 of course I open phone and have absolutely no cell service. The citibike station does not have a printed map on it.</description>

      <description>my backprop SGD from scratch 2022-Aug 14:13 ok reviewing from last time , Yea so I had switched from relu to sigmoid on commit b88ef76daf , but yea log loss is still going up during training, so for sure got rid of the bug of how it did not make sense to map that relu output to a sigmoid since a relu only produces positive numbers and so the sigmoid therefore was only able to produce values greater than 0.</description>

      <description>[[my back prop SGD from scratch 2022-Aug]] 13:35 yea so last time I had noticed , hey on a random initialization why was the y_prob 0.5 ? I had literally just initialized a new network and got this first example, ipdb&amp;gt; p x, y (array([10.31816265, -8.80044688]), 1) while running the ipdb debug mode, and inside of train_network() , ran --&amp;gt; 186 y_prob = feed_forward(x, model.layers, verbose=False) and got ipdb&amp;gt; p y_prob 0.</description>

      <description>[[my back prop SGD from scratch 2022-Aug]] 16:38 why no learning going on hmm look at this network import network as n import dataset import plot X, Y = dataset.build_dataset_inside_outside_circle(0.5) model = n.initialize_model({&amp;quot;learning_rate&amp;quot;: 0.01}) ( loss_vec, model, artifacts, X_validation, Y_validation, Y_prob ) = n.train_network(X, Y, model) 17:02 wondering if I can inspect the gradient, to see if it is pointing where it should 23:02 so for a random weight initialized network, curious at least here the response should be nonlinear right?</description>

      <description>hmm blah blah test something #publish-this What So I had a particular need to load a #[[scikit learn sklearn]] model trained with 0.20.4 on Databricks 10.4 and ran into some fun details
I was not initially able to use the Databricks 10.4 pinned version of scikit-learn , 0.24.x because of course there were #backwards-compatibility issues where trying to load the model gave me an error saying that ModuleNotFoundError: No module named &#39;sklearn.</description>

      <description>Today I thought it would take me maybe half an hour to replace my laptop battery. I got a replacement in the mail. Actually funny enough they are called the &amp;ldquo;function keys&amp;rdquo; battery because there are three cells .
Anyway, turns out they are glued to the inside and you need some kind of epoxy loosener. I randomly stumbled on this video someone put together using some kind of wax line to actually remove batteries.</description>

When (not if) you take notes, less is more and you achieve this by writing like the git diff building on what you already know; you write what you have learned You write in your own words, distilling the gist, to make retention more likely. The [[slip box]] can make writing easier by replacing planning with the execution of small incremental well defined tasks, &amp;ldquo;Read with a pen and make fleeting notes&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;write literature notes from fleeting notes&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;create permanent notes around topics that tug at your interests as you go along&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;have interactive discussions with your slip box, making connections between your permanent notes as you go along&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;dump your permanent notes as outlines for manuscripts you can work on and edit until you are satisfied.</description>

But I would be curious to try a job that uses fewer workers and more workers, to see how the outcomes compare. I also like ethat this notebook supports SQL and also python , using what looks like first line as %python to indicate the language.</description>

      <description>Two updates to the earlier steak post. Earlier, I was getting a really low temperature on the meat thermometer I was using and I am pretty sure now that was because I was only dipping just the tip as opposed to basically burying the thermometer lengthwise. This time around I seem to be getting the expected temperature, above 130 F and even above 140 F, whereas before this temperature was not registering even though I had validated that it was working on some pie for instance.</description>

      <description>For my EasyBlogPosting project.. Testing out the Dropbox API..
2020-12-09 trying this out Per here &amp;hellip; pip install dropbox Went w/ that Getting Started page Through that page, I created a new test app for myself.
Using the API explorer &amp;hellip; I hit Get Token ..
https://www.dropbox.com/oauth2/authorize?response_type=token&amp;amp;client_id=xxxxxxxxx&amp;amp;redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fdropbox.github.io%2Fdropbox-api-v2-explorer%2F&amp;amp;state=file_requests_list!39%2B%2Bxxxxxxxx&amp;amp;token_access_type=online&amp;amp;
That generated a token and I used https://dropbox.github.io/dropbox-api-v2-explorer/#files_list_folder and I was able to see actual folders in my account. That&amp;rsquo;s cool except I thought I had chosen something like &amp;lsquo;single folder access&amp;rsquo; so I&amp;rsquo;m slightly confused why I can see the other folders.</description>

      <description>This is a summary of &amp;ldquo;The Mundanity of Excellence: An Ethnographic Report on Stratification and Olympic Swimmers&amp;rdquo; by Daniel F. Chambliss.
In three sentences The author has spent a lot of time reporting on all levels of swimming competition and writes about observations about the differences between them.
The differences in abilities of different levels of competition are not because of quantitative differences like &amp;ldquo;more training&amp;rdquo; but qualitative differences like using a flip turn instead of just touching the wall and turning around.</description>

However, the new washing machine was basically destroying the delicates that required cold water. Somehow even on the coldest water setting, the water still ended up being too hot.
One example, of what the super hot water was doing to the colors, Look behind you!</description>

      <description>The material source &amp;ldquo;Rabbit Rever&amp;rdquo; by Susan Orlean published in &amp;ldquo;New Yorker&amp;rdquo; in the &amp;ldquo;July 6 2020&amp;rdquo; edition
The article in 3 sentences The author writes about how the rabbit, apparently domesticated for hundreds of years now, has been all of livestock, fur source and since mid century a third most popular choice of pet in the US. But a highly contagious and highly lethal &amp;ldquo;Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease&amp;rdquo; ( RHD the &amp;ldquo;rabbit Ebola&amp;rdquo;) caused by a lagovirus from the Caliciviridae family, has been wiping out populations of rabbits outside the US since 1984, but in mid 2019, dead rabbits fitting the RHD signs were showing up in the islands near Seattle and in Texas, Arizona and New Mexico not long after.</description>

      <description>I was reading Team of Teams sometime around September 2019. I at least remember reading it in a really cold Starbucks in a mall in Tokyo haha. First, the standard template:
The book in three sentences Team of Teams is former General Stanley McChrystal&amp;rsquo;s account of his time at the Joint Chiefs of Staff and in his role in the conflict with AQI (Al-Qaeda in Iraq) and Abu Musab al Zarqawi.</description>

      <description>Quick idea around more active content consumption My goal is to write about/ annotate what I read/ watch Just came up with a pattern of consumption to enable this. So on a youtube video for example, I can &amp;ldquo;Share&amp;rdquo; into &amp;ldquo;Dropbox&amp;rdquo; , specifically into a new folder say, of just metadata Then I found this youtube api doc where you can actually give the hyoutube api a youtube id and it will give you the metadata, like title, channel name, date, etc Then in a separate place, I can have my actual notes but they can now get linked together more easily, because I have the matching metadata.</description>

      <description>Summary Here is an early draft of a post, trying to extract some of the insights from the project here. There is a lot to write about and I want to just start getting it out.
Quick outline The logloss upper bound Does the &amp;ldquo;k area&amp;rdquo; metric help? training balancing Is it possible to calculate the Bayesian error rate here? And logloss seems to be very sensitive. (can look at correlations , not super high) So what metric should be used ?</description>

I have picked up my bike share data learning project from earlier, to try to redo it after having gathered more experience. I want to just jot down some ad hoc thoughts here.
This is mainly around navigating XGBoost.
There are two XGBoost APIs With the sklearn API you can
import xgboost as xgb from xgboost import XGBClassifier import numpy as np from sklearn.</description>

      <description>Not sure yet. There are a fitness trackers out there, but I am curious if my chest band can help. I took a quick look at one of my recordings on the Wahoo app, but I don&amp;rsquo;t see anything more granular than just beats per minute. The app indeed has pushed to Apple Health, but I only see the bpm data and no HRV data.
Didnt finish this but I tried parsing the raw fit file Making a note for later I suppose.</description>

      <description>Here I&amp;rsquo;m doing one of the Keras hello world micro projects, involving classification of tiny 28x28 wardrobe images. This was really fun. ( Here&amp;rsquo;s the original home for the python notebook). One really fun part of this was that at the end I hand drew my own clothing samples, paired them down using the python PIL library and threw them against the classifier. Surprisingly, the mini model performed really well. That&amp;rsquo;s some generalizability!</description>

Comparing the Lavazza grounds to the Opascope grounds I can&amp;rsquo;t tell there&amp;rsquo;s a difference. Is it too fine? Not fine enough?
This is the hand grinder.
Here is what 2 out of 4 of the Blue Bottle pulls ended up like

The Book in Three Sentences Meritocracy replaced direct inheritance style aristocracy after the post World War II baby boomers overwhelmed colleges&amp;ndash;forcing them to create the SAT to deal with admissions&amp;ndash;and has been snowballing a self reinforcing selection process that has been undoing the middle class ever since. The elite make bank slogging gnarly hours more than by stereotypical capital gains loop holes and &amp;ldquo;the rest&amp;rdquo; work fewer hours, involuntarily left out of the economy.</description>

      <description>I have been trying to solve the steak puzzle for several attempts now. That is, how do you cook a good cast iron to oven transfer? The problem so far has been that the recommended time for the oven for a 450 finish, in this article , 4-5 minutes is the recommendation for a medium steak and 2-4 minutes for a rare.
Although I did not quite follow the 450, I used 400 F, I followed the temperature lore from here last night, using a meat thermometer instead of time, because I suspect oven temperatures in one oven is not the same as that of another.</description>

      <description>Vitamin D questions There are a couple mini researach questions I have around Vitamin D. How different are humans with respect to Vitamin D, from other life forms or just other mammals. Also what does the synthesis pathway look like for Vitamin D (or more than one pathway if dietary is a separate pathway from skin). And how exactly does vitamin D enable immune function?
The names. Per 1 , &amp;ldquo;plasma concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D&amp;rdquo; is one &amp;ldquo;vitamin D&amp;rdquo; biomarker.</description>
