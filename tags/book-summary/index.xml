started reading [[February 2nd, 2021]] finished [[April 3rd, 2021]] Author [[Sonke Ahrens]] These are my [[literature notes]] I suppose. Book in three sentences
When (not if) you take notes, less is more and you achieve this by writing like the git diff building on what you already know; you write what you have learned You write in your own words, distilling the gist, to make retention more likely. The [[slip box]] can make writing easier by replacing planning with the execution of small incremental well defined tasks, &amp;ldquo;Read with a pen and make fleeting notes&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;write literature notes from fleeting notes&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;create permanent notes around topics that tug at your interests as you go along&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;have interactive discussions with your slip box, making connections between your permanent notes as you go along&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;dump your permanent notes as outlines for manuscripts you can work on and edit until you are satisfied.</description>

      <description>Reference Title &amp;ldquo;The Practice&amp;rdquo; Author [[Seth Godin]] Book in three Sentences (almost) ( Here&amp;rsquo;s my first stab at this, on [[February 1st, 2021]] ) If you&amp;rsquo;re not on the hook, then you are working as an #amateur or as a #hack Your daily practice is not about doing what you love but loving what you do. Author says if you are not doing for someone other than yourself, then that is also #amateur status.</description>
